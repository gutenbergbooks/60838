<h1>THE ROD AND GUN CLUB.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOME DISGUSTED BOYS.</span></h2>

<p>“Well, young man, I will tell you, for your
satisfaction, that I have got you provided,
for, for four long years to come.”</p>

<p>The speaker was Mr. Brigham. As he uttered
these words he placed his hat and gloves on the
table, and looked down at his son Lester, who
had just entered the library in obedience to the
summons he had received, and who sat on the
edge of the sofa, twirling his cap in his hands.
The boy looked frightened, while the expression
on his father’s face told very plainly that he was
angry about something.</p>

<p>“I have had quite enough of your nonsense,”
continued Mr. Brigham, in very decided tones.
“Since we came to Mississippi you have done
nothing but roam about the woods and fields with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
your gun on your shoulder, and get yourself into
trouble. You made yourself so very disagreeable
that none of the decent boys in the settlement
would have anything to do with you, and consequently
you had to take up with such fellows as
Bob Owens and Dan Evans. After setting fire to
Don Gordon’s shooting-box, and being caught in
the act of stealing David Evans’s quails, you had
to go and mix yourself up in that mail robbery.
Why, Lester, have you any idea where you will
bring up if you do not at once begin to mend your
ways?”</p>

<p>“Why, father, I had nothing to do with that,”
exclaimed Lester, trying to look surprised and innocent;
“nothing whatever. You know, as well
as I do, that I was at home when those men who
lived in that house-boat waylaid and robbed the
mail-carrier.”</p>

<p>“I am aware that you took no active part in
the work,” said his father. “If you had, you
would now be confined in the calaboose. But you
told Dan Evans about those checks for five thousand
dollars that my agent sends me every month.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” interrupted Lester.</p>

<p>“Everything goes to prove that you did,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Mr. Brigham. “If you didn’t, how does
it come that Dan knew all about those checks?
He made a full confession to Don Gordon. The
story is all over the country, and the people about
here are very angry at you. Suppose that Dan
had shot Don Gordon, as he tried to do? What
do you suppose would become of you? I really
believe you would have been mobbed before this
time. I wonder if you have any idea of the excitement
you have raised in the settlement?”</p>

<p>No; Lester had not the faintest conception of
it, for the simple reason that he had held no conversation
with anybody, save the members of
his own family, since the afternoon on which Dan
Evans was overpowered and robbed of his mail-bag.
When the full particulars of the affair came
to his ears, he was as frightened as a boy could be,
and live. He knew that he was in a measure responsible
for the robbery, that it would never have
been committed if he had held his tongue regarding
his father’s money, and the fear that he had
rendered himself liable to punishment at the hands
of the law, nearly drove him frantic. His terror
was greatly increased by his father’s last words.
There had not been so much excitement in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
settlement since the war—not even when it became
known that Clarence Gordon and Godfrey
Evans had dug up a portion of the general’s potato
patch, in the hope of unearthing eighty thousand
dollars in gold and silver that were supposed
to be buried there. Don Gordon had more friends
than any other boy in the settlement, unless it
was Bert, and the planters were enraged at the
attempt that had been made upon his life. If
Dan Evans’s bullet had found a lodgment in his
body instead of going harmlessly through the roof,
Dan and Lester Brigham, as well as the three
flatboatmen who stole the mail, might have had a
hard time of it.</p>

<p>Lester’s first care was to hide himself in the
house, as he had done after he and Bob Owens
burned Don’s old shooting-box. He earnestly
hoped that the men would escape with their
plunder; but when he learned that a strong party,
led by General Gordon, had pursued them in Davis’s
sailboat and captured them, he was ready to
give up in despair. Judge Packard would have
to look into the matter now through his judicial
spectacles, and Lester did not want to be summoned
to appear as a witness. Neither did Dan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who, disregarding the advice Don Gordon had
given him, took to the woods and hid there, just
as he did after he picked his father’s pocket of the
hundred and sixty dollars that David had made
by trapping quails.</p>

<p>When Mr. Brigham saw that Lester took to
staying in the house, and that he had suddenly
lost all interest in hunting and shooting, his suspicions
were aroused. He always kept his ears
open when he went to the landing, and by putting
together the disjointed scraps of conversation he
overheard while he was waiting for his mail, he
finally accumulated a mass of evidence against his
son Lester that fairly staggered him.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t believe this of you until I went to
Gordon and asked him what he knew about it,”
continued Mr. Brigham. “Then the whole story
came out. Lester, you will have to go away from
here.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want to do,” exclaimed the
boy, in joyous tones. “I never did like this place.
It is awful lonely and dull, and there is no one for
me to associate with. If I could only go off somewhere
on a visit——”</p>

<p>“As I told you, at the start, I have got things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fixed for you for four years to come,” said Mr.
Brigham. “You ought to have something to do—something
that will occupy your mind so completely
that you will have no time to be discontented
or to think of anything wrong. I have decided
to send you to school; and I am sorry I
didn’t do it long ago.”</p>

<p>When Lester heard this he threw his cap spitefully
down upon the floor, planted his elbow viciously
upon the arm of the lounge, and looked
very sullen indeed. School-rooms and school-books
were his pet aversions.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to do that,” said he, angrily.
“I would much rather stay here.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to grow up in ignorance?” demanded
his father.</p>

<p>If Lester had given an honest response to this
question it would have been: “No, I don’t want
to grow up in ignorance, but I do want to live at
my ease. I desire to go to some place where I can
find plenty to amuse me, and where I shall have
no labor to perform, either mental or manual.”
But he did not quite like to say that, and so he
said nothing.</p>

<p>“You don’t know a single thing that a boy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
your age ought to know,” continued Mr. Brigham.
“I have just had a long conversation with Gordon
and his two boys.”</p>

<p>Lester looked up with a startled expression on
his face. “You haven’t determined to send me
to Bridgeport, have you?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I have,” was the decided answer.</p>

<p>“To the military academy?” asked Lester, in
louder and more incredulous tones.</p>

<p>“That’s the very place. The systematic drill
and training you will there receive, will be of the
greatest benefit to you, if you are only willing to
profit by them. That school has made men of
Don and Bert Gordon already.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” sneered Lester, suddenly recalling
some items of information that had come
to him in a round-about way. “Don has been in
a constant row with the teachers ever since he has
been there.”</p>

<p>“That is not true. He got himself into trouble
when he first entered the school, and lost his
shoulder-straps by it; but he has toned down
wonderfully under the influence of those three
boys he brought home with him, and he is bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to make his mark before his four years’ course is
completed.”</p>

<p>“But, father, do you know that the teachers
are awful hard on the boys—that if a student
looks out of the wrong corner of his eye, or breaks
the smallest one of the thousand and more rules
that he is expected to keep constantly in mind, he
is punished for it?” asked Lester, who was almost
ready to cry with vexation. It was bad enough,
he told himself, to be sent away to any school
against his will; but it was worse for his father to
select a military academy, and then to hold that
embodiment of mischief and rebellion, Don Gordon,
up to him as an object worthy of emulation.
Lester had no desire to learn the tactics, and he
dreaded the discipline to which he knew he would
be subjected.</p>

<p>“I heard all about it during my talk with Don
and Bert,” replied his father. “A strong hand
and plenty of work are just what you need.”</p>

<p>“But do you know that Bert is first sergeant
of the company to which I shall probably be assigned,
and that one of its corporals is a New
York boot-black? Do you want me to obey the
orders of a street Arab?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“He could not have attained to the position he
holds unless he had proved himself worthy of it.
The majority of the students, however, are the
sons of wealthy men, and they are the ones I want
you to choose for your associates. Make friends
with them and bring some of them home with you,
as Don and Bert did, or go home with them, if
they ask you. My word for it, you will see plenty
of sport there, if you will only do your duty faithfully.
Gordon’s boys are impatient to go back;
and yet there was a time when Don disliked school
as heartily as you do.”</p>

<p>“When shall we start for Bridgeport?”</p>

<p>“A week from next Wednesday. New students
are received up to the 13th of the month; so we
must make our application two days before the
school begins.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll not go up on the same boat
with the Gordons?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Having been there before, they
can save us a great deal of trouble by telling us
just where to go and what to do.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t like the idea of traveling in their
company. They will snub me every chance they
get.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“You need not borrow any trouble on that
score. They have good reasons for disliking you,
but if you conduct yourself properly, you will have
nothing to fear from them. Now, Lester, promise
me that, if you are admitted to that school, you
will wake up and try to accomplish something. I
will do everything I can to aid and encourage you,
and I will begin by putting it in your power to
hold your own with the richest student there.”</p>

<p>Lester perfectly understood his father’s last
words, and he was considerably mollified by them.
If there were anything that could reconcile him to
becoming a member of the military academy, it
was the knowledge of the fact that a liberal supply
of spending money was to be placed at his disposal.
Lester’s highest ambition was to be looked
up to as a leader among his companions. He had
failed to accomplish his object so far as the boys
about Rochdale were concerned, but he was pretty
sure that he would not fail at Bridgeport. He
didn’t, either. His money, which Mr. Brigham
might better have kept in his own pocket, brought
him to the notice of some uneasy fellows at the
academy, who joined him in a daring enterprise,
the like of which had never been heard of before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
It gave the village people something to talk about,
and furnished the law-abiding students with any
amount of fun and excitement. In fact the whole
school term was crowded so full of thrilling incidents,
so many things happened to take their
minds off their books, that when the examination
was held, some of the best scholars narrowly escaped
being dropped from their classes.</p>

<p>“I will do anything I can for you,” repeated
Mr. Brigham, seating himself in the nearest chair
and taking a newspaper from the table. “If you
will go through the four years’ course with flying
colors, and come out at the head of your class, I
shall be highly gratified, and I assure you that
you will lose nothing by it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brigham fastened his eyes upon his paper,
and Lester, taking this as a hint that he had nothing
more to say just then, picked up his cap and
went out. He made his way directly to his own
room, and taking his squirrel rifle down from the
antlers that supported it—purchased antlers they
were, and not trophies of the boy’s own skill—he
buckled a cartridge belt about his waist and left
the house. He wanted to go off in the woods by
himself and think the matter over; but it is hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to tell why he took his rifle with him, for he had
no intention of hunting, and he could not have
killed anything if he had. Perhaps it was because
he had fallen into the habit of carrying a weapon
on his shoulder wherever he went, just as Godfrey
and Dan did.</p>

<p>“It is some comfort to know that the governor
is not disposed to put me on short allowance,”
thought he, as he sat down on a log and rested his
rifle across his knees, “and perhaps I can manage
to stand it for a while. If I can’t, and father
won’t let me come home, I’ll skip out, as Bob
Owens did; only I’ll not go into the army. But
it can’t be all work and no play up there. There
must be some jolly fellows among the students
who are in for having a good time now and then,
and they are the ones I shall run with. I am sorry
Bert is an officer, for he will tyrannize over me
in every possible way. I feel disgusted whenever
I think of that.”</p>

<p>Lester Brigham was not the only boy in the
world who felt disgusted that day. There were
three others that we know of. One of them lived
away off in Maryland, and the others lived in
Rochdale. The last were Don and Bert Gordon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>When their father came into the room in which
they were sitting and told them that Mr. Brigham
was waiting to see them in the parlor, they followed
him lost in wonder, which gave place to a very
different feeling when they learned that this visitor
had come there to make some inquiries regarding
the Bridgeport military academy, with a view of
sending his son there. Bert gave truthful replies
to all his questions, and so did Don, for the matter
of that; but he did not neglect to enlarge
upon the severity of the discipline, or to call Mr.
Brigham’s attention to the fact that no boy need
go to that school expecting to keep pace with his
classes, unless he was willing to study hard. Believing
that Lester would make trouble one way
or another, Don did not want him there, and he
hoped to convince Mr. Brigham that the academy
at Bridgeport would not at all suit Lester; but
he did not succeed. The visitor seemed to believe
that military drill was just what his refractory son
needed, asked the boys when they were going to
start, thanked them for the information they had
given him, and took his leave.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I am disgusted,” exclaimed Don;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
while Bert went over to the window and drummed
upon it with his fingers.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you are going to help yourselves,
boys,” said the general. “Lester Brigham
has as much right to go to that school as you
have.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” replied Don. “But I don’t
want him there, all the same.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said Bert. “He will be in my
company, and if I make him toe the mark, he will
say that I do it because I want to be revenged on
him for burning Don’s shooting-box and getting
Dave Evans into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Do your duty as a soldier, and let Lester say
what he pleases,” said the general.</p>

<p>“Oh! he’ll have to,” exclaimed Don. “If he
doesn’t, he will be reported. Bert’s got to walk a
chalk line now, and if he makes a false step, off
come his diamond and <i>chevrons</i>. It’s some consolation
to know that we can’t introduce him to
Egan and the rest. They would snub us in a
minute if we did, and serve us right, too. A plebe
must be content to wait until the upper-class boys
get ready to speak to him.”</p>

<p>“Having passed four years of my life in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
academy I am not ignorant of that fact,” said the
general, after a little pause, during which he recalled
to mind how he had once had his face
washed in a snow-drift by a couple of second-class
boys whom he had presumed to address on terms
of familiarity. “But I hope you will do all you
can for Lester. Remember how lonely you felt
when you first went there, and found yourselves
surrounded by those who were utter strangers to
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we will,” said Bert, while Don scowled
savagely but said nothing. “If he will show us
that he has come there with the determination to
do the best he can, we’ll stand by him; won’t we,
Don?”</p>

<p>Of course the latter said they would, but he
gave the promise simply because his father desired
it, and not because he had any friendly feeling for
Lester Brigham.</p>

<p>The other disgusted boy was Egan, who, on this
particular day, was pacing up and down the back
veranda of his father’s house, shaking his fist at
the surf that was rolling in upon the beach, and
acting altogether like one whose reflections were
by no means agreeable. What it was that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
happened to annoy him, we will let him tell in his
own way.</p>

<p>Christmas, with its festivities, was now a memory.
New Year’s day came and went, and Don and
Bert, each in his own way, began making preparations
for their return to Bridgeport. The latter,
who was determined that the close of another
school year should find him with at least one bar
on his shoulder, devoted his morning hours to his
books, while Don, to quote his own language, proceeded
to put himself through a regular course of
training. There was a long siege of hard study
before him, but one would have thought, by the
way he went to work, that he was preparing himself
for a physical rather than an intellectual contest.
He rode hard, hunted perseveringly, kept
up his regular exercise with Indian clubs and
dumb-bells, and looked, as he said he felt, as if he
were good for any amount of work.</p>

<p>Knowing how valuable a little advice would
have been to them when they first joined the academy,
Don and Bert rode over to see Lester, intending
to give him some idea of the nature of the
examination he would have to pass before he would
be received as a student, and to drop a few hints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that would enable him to keep out of trouble; but
they never repeated the experiment. Lester was
surly and not at all sociable; and he was so very independent,
and seemed to have so much confidence
in his ability to make his way without help from
anybody, that his visitors took their leave without
saying half as much to him as they had intended.</p>

<p>“I know what they are up to,” said Lester, who
stood at the window watching Don and Bert as
they rode away. “They have reasons for wishing
to get on the right side of me. Somebody has
probably told them that I am to have plenty of
money to spend, and they intend that I shall spend
some of it for their own benefit. I am going in
for a shoulder-strap—I am not one to be satisfied
with a sergeant’s warrant—and the first thing I
shall do, after I get it, will be to take those stripes
off Bert Gordon’s arms. He and his boot-black
can’t order <i>me</i> around.”</p>

<p>This soliloquy will show that Lester had
changed his mind in regard to the school at Bridgeport.
He wanted to go there now. His father, who
knew nothing about the academy beyond what
Don and Bert had told him, and who judged it by
the fashionable boarding-schools at which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
obtained the little knowledge he possessed, had
neglected no opportunity to impress upon Lester’s
mind the fact that a rich man’s son would not be
allowed to remain long in the ranks, and that
there was nothing to prevent him from winning
and wearing an officer’s sword, if he would only
use a little tact in pushing himself forward. After
listening to such counsel as this, it was not at
all likely that anything that Don and Bert could
say would have any influence with him.</p>

<p>“He thinks he is going to have a walk over,”
said Don, as he stroked his pony’s glossy mane.</p>

<p>“It looks that way, but there’s where he is mistaken,”
replied Bert. “Lester will be walking an
extra before he has been at the academy a week.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll not volunteer any more advice, no
matter what happens to him,” said Don. “We’ll
let him go as he pleases and see how he will come
out.”</p>

<p>The day set for their departure came at last,
and Don and Bert, accompanied by Mr. Brigham
and Lester, set out for Bridgeport, which they
reached without any mishap. They rode in the
same hack from the depot to the academy, and when
they alighted at the door, they were surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
by a crowd of boys who had already reported for
duty, and who made it a point to rush out of the
building to extend a noisy welcome to every newcomer.
School was not yet in session, and the
first-class boys were not above speaking to a plebe.</p>

<p>Among those who were first to greet Don and
Bert as they stepped out of the hack, were Egan,
Hopkins and Curtis. As these young gentlemen
had already completed the regular academic
course, perhaps the reader would like to know
what it was that brought them back. They
came to take what was called the “finishing
course,” and to put themselves under technical
instruction. After that (it took two years to go
through it) Hopkins was to enter a lawyer’s office
in Baltimore; Egan intended to become assistant
engineer to a relative who was building railroads
somewhere in South America; while Curtis was
looking towards West Point.</p>

<p>The boys who composed these advanced classes
were privileged characters. They dressed in citizens’
clothes, performed no military duty, boarded
in the village, and came and went whenever they
pleased. When the students went into camp,
they were at liberty to go with them, or they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stay at the academy and study. If they chose the
camp, they could ask to be appointed aids or orderlies
at headquarters, or they could put on a
uniform, shoulder a musket, and fall into the
ranks. They held no office, and the boy who was
lieutenant-colonel last year, was nothing better
than a private now.</p>

<p>Don and Bert greeted their friends cordially,
and as soon as the latter could free himself from
their clutches, he beckoned to Mr. Brigham and
Lester, who followed him through the hall and
into the superintendent’s room.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">BIRDS OF A FEATHER.</span></h2>

<p>“Which one of these trunks do you belong
to, Gordon?” inquired a young second-lieutenant,
whose duty it was to see that the students
were assigned to rooms as fast as they
arrived.</p>

<p>“The one with the canvas cover is mine,” replied
Don.</p>

<p>“Any preference among the boys?” asked the
lieutenant. “You can’t have Bert for a room-mate
this term, you know. The second sergeant
of his company will be chummed on him.”</p>

<p>Don replied that he didn’t care who he had for
a companion, so long as he was a well-behaved
boy; whereupon the lieutenant beckoned to a
negro porter whom he called “Rosebud,” and
directed him to take Don’s trunk up to No. 45,
third floor.</p>

<p>“By the way, I suppose that that fellow who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
has just gone into the superintendent’s room with
Bert is a crony of yours?” continued the young
officer.</p>

<p>“He is from Mississippi,” said Don. He did
not wish to publish the fact that Lester Brigham
was no friend of his, for that would prejudice the
students against him at once. Lester was likely
to have a hard time of it at the best, and Don did
not want to say or do anything that would make
it harder for him.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the officer. “I will take pains
to see that he is chummed on some good fellow.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t put yourself to any trouble for
him on my account,” said Don in a low tone, at
the same time turning his back upon a sprucely-dressed
but rather brazen-faced boy, who persisted
in crowding up close to him and Egan, as if he
meant to hear every word that passed between
them. “He is nothing to me, and I wish he was
back where he came from. He’ll wish so too, before
he has been here many days. I said everything
I could to induce his father to keep him at
home, but he——”</p>

<p>“Let’s take a walk as far as the gate,” said
Egan, seizing Don by the arm and nodding to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Hopkins and Curtis. “You stay here, Enoch,”
he added, turning to the sprucely-dressed boy.</p>

<p>“What’s the reason I can’t go too?” demanded
the latter.</p>

<p>“Because we don’t want you,” replied Egan,
bluntly. “I told you before we left home, that
you needn’t expect to hang on to my coat-tails.
Make friends with the members of your own company,
for they are the only associates you will
have after school begins.”</p>

<p>“But they are all strangers to me, and you
won’t introduce me,” said Enoch.</p>

<p>“Then pitch in and get acquainted, as I did
when I first came here. You may be sure I’ll not
introduce you,” said Egan, in a low voice, as he
and his three friends walked toward the gate.
“An introduction is an indorsement, and I don’t
indorse any such fellows as you are.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?” asked Don,
who had never seen Egan so annoyed and provoked
as he was at that moment.</p>

<p>“Everything,” replied the ex-sergeant. “He’s
the meanest boy I ever met—I except nobody—and
if he doesn’t prove to be a second Clarence
Duncan, I shall miss my guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“The boy who came here with me will make a
good mate for him,” said Don.</p>

<p>“This fellow’s father has only recently moved
into our neighborhood,” continued Egan. “He
went into ecstasies over my uniform the first time
he saw it, and wanted to know where I got it, and
how much it cost, and all that sort of thing. Of
course I praised the school and everybody and
everything connected with it; but I wish now that
I had kept still. The next time that I met him
he told me that when I returned to Bridgeport
he was going with me. I was in hopes he wouldn’t
stick, but he did.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brigham crowded Lester upon Bert and
me in about the same way,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Was that Lester Brigham?” exclaimed Curtis—“the
boy who burned your old shooting-box
and kicked up that rumpus while we were at
Rochdale? We often heard you speak of him,
but you know we never saw him.”</p>

<p>“He’s the very one,” replied Don.</p>

<p>“Then he will make a good mate for Enoch
Williams,” said Egan. “Why, Don, this fellow
has been caught in the act of looting ducks on the
bay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Egan’s tone and manner seemed to indicate that
he looked upon this as one of the worst offenses
that could be committed, and both he and Hopkins
were surprised because Don did not grow angry
over it.</p>

<p>“What’s looting ducks?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>“It is a system of hunting pursued by the pot-hunters
of Chesapeake bay, who shoot for the
market and not for sport. A huge blunderbuss,
which will hold a handful of powder and a pound
or more of shot, and which is kept concealed during
the day-time, is put into the bow of a skiff at
night, and carried into the very midst of a flock
of sleeping ducks; and sometimes the men who
manage it, secure as many as sixty or seventy
birds at one discharge. The law expressly prohibits
it, and denounces penalties against those
who are caught at it.”</p>

<p>“Then why wasn’t Enoch punished?”</p>

<p>“Because everybody is afraid to complain of
him or of any one else who violates the law. It
isn’t safe to say anything against these duck-shooters,
and those who do it are sure to suffer.
Their yachts will be bored full of holes, their
oyster-beds dragged at night or filled with sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
things for the dredges to catch on, their lobster-pots
pulled up and destroyed or carried off, their
retrievers shot or stolen—oh, it wouldn’t take
long to raise an excitement down there that would
be fully equal to that which was occasioned in
Rochdale by that mail robbery.”</p>

<p>If the reader will bear these words in mind, he
will see that subsequent events proved the truthfulness
of them. The professional duck-shooters
who played such havoc with the wild fowl in
Chesapeake bay, were determined and vindictive
men, and it was very easy to get into trouble with
them, especially when there were such fellows as
Enoch Williams and Lester Brigham to help it
along.</p>

<p>The four friends spent half an hour in walking
about the grounds, talking over the various exciting
and amusing incidents that had happened
while they were living in <i>Don Gordon’s Shooting-Box</i>,
and then Don went to his dormitory
to put on his uniform, preparatory to reporting
his arrival to the superintendent. Every train
that steamed into the station brought a crowd of
students with it, and the evening of the 14th of
January found them all snug in their quarters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and ready for the serious business of the term,
which was to begin with the booming of the morning
gun. All play was over now. There had
been guard-mount that morning, sentries were
posted on the grounds and in the buildings, and
the new students began to see how it seemed to
feel the tight reins of military discipline drawn
about them. Of course there were a good many
who did not like it at all. Events proved that there
was a greater number of malcontents in the school
this term than there had ever been before. Bold
fellows some of them were, too—boys who had
always been allowed to do as they pleased at home,
and who proceeded to get up a rebellion before
they had donned their uniforms. One of them, it
is hardly necessary to say, was Lester Brigham.
On the morning when the ceremony of guard-mounting
was gone through with for the first time,
he stood off by himself, muffled up head and ears,
and watching the proceeding. Presently his attention
was attracted by the actions of a boy who
came rapidly along the path, shaking his gloved
fists in the air and talking to himself. He did not
see Lester until he was close upon him, and then
he stopped and looked ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked Lester, who was
in no very good humor himself.</p>

<p>“Matter enough,” replied the boy. “I wish I
had never seen or heard of this school.”</p>

<p>“Here too,” said Lester. “Are you a new
scholar? Then we belong to the same class and
company.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t belong to any class or company if
I could help it,” snapped the boy. “My father
didn’t want me to come here, but I insisted, like
the dunce I was, and now I’ve got to stay.”</p>

<p>“So have I; but I didn’t come of my own free
will. My father made me.”</p>

<p>“Get into any row at home?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Well—yes,” replied Lester, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that it is anything to be ashamed
of. You look like a city boy; did the cops get
after you?”</p>

<p>“No; I had no trouble with the police, but I
thought for a while that I was going to have. I
live in the canebrakes of Mississippi, and my name
is Lester Brigham. I used to live in the city, and
I wish I had never left it.”</p>

<p>“My name is Enoch Williams, and I am from
Maryland,” said the other. “I don’t live in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
cane-brake, but I live on the sea-shore, and right
in the midst of a lot of Yahoos who don’t know
enough to keep them over night. Egan is one of
them and Hopkins is another.”</p>

<p>“Why, those are two of the boys that Don Gordon
brought home with him last fall,” exclaimed
Lester. “Do you know them?”</p>

<p>“I know Egan very well. His father’s plantation
is next to ours. If he had been anything of a
gentleman, I might have been personally acquainted
with Hopkins by this time; but, although we
traveled in company all the way from Maryland,
he never introduced me. Do you know them?”</p>

<p>“I used to see them occasionally last fall, but I
have never spoken to either of them,” answered
Lester. “By the way, the first sergeant of our
company is a near neighbor of mine.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Bert Gordon? Well, he’s a
little snipe. He throws on more airs than a country
dancing-master. I have been insulted ever
since I have been here,” said Enoch, hotly. “The
boys from my own State, who ought to have
brought me to the notice of the teachers and
of some good fellows among the students, have
turned their backs upon me, and told me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
so many words, that they don’t want my company.”</p>

<p>“Don and Bert Gordon have treated me in
nearly the same way,” observed Lester.</p>

<p>“But, for all that, I have made some acquaintances
among the boys in the third class, who gave
me a few hints that I intend to act upon,” continued
Enoch. “They say the rules are very strict,
and that it is of no earthly use for me to try to
keep out of trouble. There are a favored few who
are allowed to do as they please; but the rest of
us must walk turkey, or spend our Saturday afternoons
in doing extra duty. Now I say that isn’t
fair—is it, Jones?” added Enoch, appealing to a
third-class boy who just then came up.</p>

<p>Jones had been at the academy just a year, and
of course he was a member of Don Gordon’s class
and company. He was one of those who, by the
aid of Don’s “Yankee Invention,” had succeeded
in making their way into the fire-escape, and out
of the building. They failed to get by the guard,
as we know, and Jones was court-martialed as well
as the rest. His back and arms ached whenever
he thought of the long hours he had spent in
walking extras to pay for that one night’s fun;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and he had made the mental resolution that before
he left the academy he would do something
that would make those who remained bear him in
remembrance. He was lazy, vicious and idle, and
quite willing to back up Enoch’s statement.</p>

<p>“Of course it isn’t fair,” said he, after Enoch
had introduced him to Lester Brigham. “You
needn’t expect to be treated fairly as long as you
remain here, unless you are willing to curry favor
with the teachers, and so win a warrant or a commission;
but that is something no decent boy will
do. I can prove it to you. Take the case of Don
Gordon: he’s a good fellow, in some respects——”</p>

<p>“There’s where I differ with you,” interrupted
Lester. “I have known him for a long time, and
I have yet to see anything good about him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you have. I say he’s a good
fellow,” said Jones, earnestly. “There isn’t a
better boy in school to run with than Don Gordon
would be, if he would only get rid of the notion
that it is manly to tell the truth at all times and
under all circumstances, no matter who suffers by
it. He’s as full of plans as an egg is of meat; he
is afraid of nothing, and there wasn’t a boy in our
set who dared join him in carrying out some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
schemes he proposed. Why, he wanted to capture
the butcher’s big bull-dog, take him up to the top
of the building, and then kick him down stairs
after tying a tin-can to his tail! He would have
done it, too, if any of the set had offered to help
him; but I tell you, I wouldn’t have taken a hand
in it for all the money there is in America.”</p>

<p>“He must be a good one,” said Enoch, admiringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, he is. We had many a pleasant evening
at Cony Ryan’s last winter that we would not
have had if Don had not come to our aid; but
when the critical moment arrived, he failed us.”</p>

<p>“You might have expected it,” sneered Lester,
who could not bear to hear these words of praise
bestowed upon the boy he so cordially hated.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t expect it. Don was one of the
floor-guards that night, and he allowed a lot of us
to pass him and go out of the building. When
the superintendent hauled him up for it the next
day, he acknowledged his guilt, but he would not
give our names, although he knew he stood a good
chance of being sent down for his refusal. I shall
always honor him for that.”</p>

<p>“I wish he had been expelled,” said Lester, bitterly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
“Then I should not have been sent to this
school.”</p>

<p>“Well, when the examination came off,” continued
Jones, “Don was so far ahead of his class
that none of them could touch him with a ten-foot
pole; and yet he is a private to-day, while
that brother of his, who won the good-will of the
teachers by toadying to them, wears a first sergeant’s
<i>chevrons</i>. Of course such partiality as
that is not fair for the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a single redeeming feature about
this school, is there?” said Enoch, after a pause.
“A fellow can’t enjoy himself in any way.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he can—if he is smart and a trifle
reckless. He can go to Cony Ryan’s and eat pancakes.
I suppose Egan told you of the high old
times we had here last winter running the guard,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He never mentioned it,” replied Enoch.</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t he describe the fight we had with
the Indians last camp?”</p>

<p>“Indians!” repeated Enoch, incredulously,
while Lester’s eyes opened with amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes; sure-enough Indians they were too, and
not make-believes. We thought, by the way they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
yelled at us, that they meant business. Why,
they raised such a rumpus about the camp that
some of our lady guests came very near fainting,
they were so frightened. Didn’t Egan tell you
how he and Don deserted, swam the creek, went
to the show disguised as country boys, and finally
fell into the hands of those same Indians who had
surrounded the camp and were getting ready to
attack us?”</p>

<p>No, Egan hadn’t said a word about any of these
things to Enoch, and neither had Don or Bert
spoken of them to Lester; although they might
have done so if the latter had showed them a little
more courtesy when they called upon him at his
house. Some of the matters referred to were
pleasant episodes in the lives of the Bridgeport
students, and the reason why Egan had not spoken
of them was because he did not want Enoch to
think there was anything agreeable about the institution.
He didn’t want him there, because he
did not believe that Enoch would be any credit to
the school; and so he did with him just as Don
and Bert did with Lester: he enlarged upon the
rigor of the discipline, the stern impartiality of
the instructors, the promptness with which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
called a delinquent to account, and spoke feelingly
of their long and difficult lessons; but he never
said “recreation” once, nor did he so much as
hint that there were certain hours in the day that
the students could call their own.</p>

<p>“Tell us about that fight,” said Enoch.</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” chimed in Lester. “If there is any
way to see fun here, let us know what it is.”</p>

<p>Jones was just the boy to go to with an appeal
of this sort. He was thoroughly posted, and if
there were any one in the academy who was
always ready to set the rules and regulations at
defiance, especially if he saw the shadow of a
chance for escaping punishment, Jones was the
fellow. He gave a glowing description of the battle
at the camp; told how the boys ran the guard,
and where they went and what they did after they
got out; related some thrilling stories of adventure
of which the law-breakers were the heroes;
and by the time the dinner-call was sounded, he
had worked his two auditors up to such a pitch
of excitement that they were ready to attempt
almost anything.</p>

<p>“You have given me some ideas,” said Enoch,
as they hurried toward their dormitories in obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to the call, “and who knows but they may
grow to something? I’ve got to stay here—I had
a plain understanding with my father on that
point—and I am going to think up something
that will yield us some sport.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I like to hear a fellow talk,”
said Jones, approvingly; “and I will tell you
this for your encouragement: we care nothing for
the risk we shall run in carrying out your scheme,
whatever it may be, but before we undertake it,
you must be able to satisfy us that we can carry
it out successfully. Do that, and I will bring
twenty boys to back you up, if you need so many.
We are always glad to have fellows like you come
among us, for our tricks grow stale after a while,
and we learn new ones of you. Don Gordon can
think up something in less time than anybody I
ever saw; but it would be useless to look to him
for help. Egan and the other good little boys
have taken him in hand, and they’ll make an
officer of him this year; you wait and see if they
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Jones gave me some ideas, too,” thought Lester,
as he marched into the dining-hall with his
company, and took his seat at the table; “but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
must say I despise the way he lauded that Don
Gordon. Don seems to make friends wherever he
goes, and they are among the best, too; while I
have to be satisfied with such companions as I can
get. I am going to set my wits at work and see
if I can’t study up something that will throw that
bull-dog business far into the shade.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Lester this was easy of accomplishment.
He was not obliged to do any very
hard thinking on the subject, for a plan was suggested
to him that very afternoon. There was
but one objection to it: he would have to wait
four or five months before it could be carried out.</p>

<p>Lester’s room-mate was a boy who spelled his
name Huggins, but pronounced it as though it
were written Hewguns. He had showed but little
disposition to talk about himself and his affairs,
and all Lester could learn concerning him was
that he was from Massachusetts, and that he lived
somewhere on the sea-coast. He and Lester met
in their dormitory after dinner, and while the latter
proceeded to put on his hat and overcoat,
Huggins threw himself into a chair, buried his
hands in his pockets and gazed steadily at the
floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired Lester. “You
act as if something had gone wrong with you.”</p>

<p>“Things never go right with me,” was the surly
response. “There isn’t a boy in the world who
has so much trouble as I do.”</p>

<p>“I have often thought that of myself,” Lester
remarked. “Come out and take a walk. Perhaps
the fresh air will do you good.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any fresh air,” growled Huggins.
“I want to think. I have been trying all the
morning to hit upon something that would enable
me to get to windward of my father, and I guess
I have got it at last.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by getting to windward of
him?” asked Lester.</p>

<p>“Why, getting the advantage of him. If two
vessels were racing, the one that was to windward
would have the odds of the other, especially if the
breeze was not steady, because she would always
catch it first. I guess you don’t know much about
the water, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about boats,” replied Lester;
“but when it comes to hunting, fishing or
riding, I am there. I have yet to see the fellow
who can beat me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am fond of fishing,” said Huggins. “I was
out on the banks last season. We made a very
fine catch, and had a tidy row with the Newfoundland
fishermen before we could get our bait.”</p>

<p>“What sort of fish did you take?”</p>

<p>“Codfish, of course.”</p>

<p>“Do you angle for them from the banks?”</p>

<p>“I said <i>on</i> the banks—that is, in shoal water.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Lester. “I don’t know anything
about that kind of fishing. Did you ever play a
fifteen pound brook-trout on an eight-ounce fly-rod?”</p>

<p>“No; nor nobody else.”</p>

<p>“I have done it many a time,” said Lester.
“I tell you it takes a man who understands his
business to land a fish like that with light tackle.
A greenhorn would have broken his pole or snapped
his line the very first jerk he made.”</p>

<p>“You may tell that to the marines, but you
needn’t expect me to believe it,” said Huggins,
quietly. “In the first place, a fly-fisher doesn’t
fasten his hook by giving a jerk. He does it by a
simple turn of the wrist. In the second place, the
<i>Salmo fontinalis</i> doesn’t grow to the weight of
fifteen pounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Lester was fairly staggered. He had set out
with the intention of giving his room-mate a
graphic account of some of his imaginary exploits
and adventures (those of our readers who are well
acquainted with him will remember that he kept
a large supply of them on hand), but he saw that
it was time to stop. There was no use in trying
to deceive a boy who could fire Latin at him in
that way.</p>

<p>“The largest brook-trout that was ever caught
was taken in the Rangeley lakes, and weighed a
trifle over ten pounds,” continued Huggins. “And
lastly, the members of the order <i>Salmonidæ</i> don’t
live in the muddy, stagnant bayous you have
down South. They want clear cold water.”</p>

<p>“Why do you want to get to windward of your
father?” inquired Lester, who thought it best to
change the subject.</p>

<p>“To pay him for sending me to this school,”
replied Huggins.</p>

<p>“And you think you know how to do it?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>Lester became interested. He took off his hat
and overcoat and sat down on the edge of his bed.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">LESTER BRIGHAM’S IDEA.</span></h2>

<p>“If one might judge by the way you talk and
act, you didn’t want to come to this school,”
said Lester.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” answered Huggins. “I don’t
want to go to any school. The height of my ambition
is to become a sailor. I was born in sight
of the ocean, and have snuffed its breezes and been
tossed about by its waves ever since I can remember.
I live near Gloucester, and my father is
largely interested in the cod-fishery. He began
life as a fisherman, but he owns a good sized fleet
now.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he want you to go to sea?” asked
Lester.</p>

<p>“No. He allowed me to go to the banks now
and then, but when I told him that I wanted to
make a regular business of it, he wouldn’t listen
to me. After I got tired of trying to reason with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
him, I made preparations to run away from home;
but he caught me at it, and bundled me off here.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stay. I’ve been to school
before, but I was never snubbed as I have been
since I came to Bridgeport. The idea that a boy
of my age should be obliged to say ‘sir’ to every
little up-start who wears a shoulder-strap! I’ll
not do it.”</p>

<p>“You’d better. If you don’t you will be in
trouble continually.”</p>

<p>“Let the trouble come. I’ll get out of its
way.”</p>

<p>“How will you do it?”</p>

<p>Huggins shut one eye, looked at Lester with
the other, and laid his finger by the side of his
nose.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t be afraid to trust me,” said
Lester, who easily understood this pantomime.
“Those who are best acquainted with me will tell
you that I am true blue. I know just how you
feel. I don’t like this school any better than you
do; I was sent here in spite of all I could say to
prevent it. I have been snubbed by the boys in
the upper classes because I spoke to them before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they spoke to me, and when I see a chance to
leave without being caught, I shall improve it.”</p>

<p>“I guess I can rely upon you to keep my
secret,” said Huggins, but it is hard to tell how
he reached this conclusion. One single glance at
that peaked, freckled face, whose every feature
bore evidence to the sneaking character and disposition
of its owner, ought to have satisfied him
that his room-mate was not a boy who could be
confided in.</p>

<p>“You may depend upon me every time,” said
Lester, earnestly. “I’ll bring twenty good fellows
to help you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t take so many boys with me,” said
Huggins, looking up in surprise. “I couldn’t find
berths for them.”</p>

<p>“Are you going off on a boat?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Some dark night, when all
the rest of the fellows are asleep, I am going to
slip out of here, take my foot in my hand and
draw a bee-line for Oxford; and when I get
there, I am going to ship aboard the first sea-going
vessel I can find.”</p>

<p>“As a sailor?” exclaimed Lester.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I shall have to go before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
mast; but I’ll not stay there, for I can hand, reef
and steer as well as the next man, I don’t care
where he comes from, and I understand navigation,
too.”</p>

<p>Lester was sadly disappointed. He hoped and
believed that his room-mate was about to propose
something in which he could join him.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I can’t go with you,” said he;
“but I don’t want to follow the sea.”</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t, for you belong ashore. I
belong on the water, and there’s where I am going.
Oxford is two hundred miles from Bridgeport,
and that is a long distance to walk through
snow that is two feet deep.”</p>

<p>“You can go on the cars,” suggested Lester.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t; unless I steal a ride. My father
is determined to keep me here, and consequently
he does not allow me a cent of money,” said Huggins;
and he proved it by turning all his pockets
inside out to show that they were empty.</p>

<p>“He is mean, isn’t he?” said Lester, indignantly.
He was about to add that his father had
given him a very liberal supply of bills before he
set out on his return to Rochdale, but he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
say it, for fear that his friend Huggins might want
to borrow a dollar or two.</p>

<p>“But he will find that I am not going to let
the want of money stand in my way,” added Huggins.
“I saw several nice little yachts in their
winter quarters when I was at the wharf the other
day, and if it were summer we’d get a party of
fellows together, run off in one of them, and go
somewhere and have some fun. When the time
came to separate, each one could go where he
pleased. The rest of you could hold a straight
course for home, if you felt like it, and I would
go to sea.”</p>

<p>“That’s the very idea,” exclaimed Lester. “I
wonder why some of the boys didn’t think of it
long ago. When you get ready to go, count me
in.”</p>

<p>“I shall not be here to take part in it,” replied
Huggins. “I hope to be on deep water before
many days more have passed over my head.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear you say so, for you would
be just the fellow to lead an expedition like that.
But there’s one thing you have forgotten: if you
intend to slip away from the academy, you will
need help.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see why I should. I shall not stir until
every one is asleep.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll not go out at all. There are sentries
posted around the grounds at this moment,
and as soon as it grows dark, guards will take
charge of every floor in this building. It is easy
enough to get by the sentries—I know, for some
of the boys told me so—but how are you going to
pass these floor-guards when they are watching
your room?”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Huggins. “They hold a
fellow tight, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“They certainly do; and it is not a very pleasant
state of affairs for one who has been allowed
to go and come whenever he felt like it. Your
best plan would be to ask for a pass. That will
take you by the guards, and when you get off the
grounds, you needn’t come back.”</p>

<p>“But suppose I can’t get a pass?”</p>

<p>“Then the only thing you can do is to wait
until some of your friends are on duty. They will
pass you and keep still about it afterward.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a single friend in the school.”</p>

<p>“You can make some by simply showing the
boys that your heart is in the right place. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
go now to meet an engagement; but I will see
you later, and if you like, I will introduce you to
a few acquaintances I have made since my arrival,
every one of whom you can trust.”</p>

<p>As Lester said this, he put on his hat and overcoat
and left the room. Huggins had given him
an idea, and he wanted to get away by himself and
think about it. He did not have time to spend a
great deal of study upon it, for as he was about
to pass out at the front door, he met Jones, who
was just the boy he wanted to see. He was in the
company of several members of his class, but a
wink and a slight nod of the head quickly brought
him to Lester’s side.</p>

<p>“Say, Jones,” whispered the latter, “I understand
that there are a good many yachts owned in
this village, and that they are in their winter
quarters now. When warm weather comes, what
would you say to capturing one of them, and going
off somewhere on a picnic?”</p>

<p>“Lester, you’re a good one,” exclaimed Jones,
admiringly.</p>

<p>“Do you think it could be done?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” replied Jones, who grew enthusiastic
at once. “It’s the very idea, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
know the boys will be in for it hot and heavy. It
takes the new fellows to get up new schemes. I
can see only two objections to it.”</p>

<p>“What are they?” inquired Lester.</p>

<p>“The first is, that we can’t carry it out under
four or five months. Couldn’t you think up something
that we could go at immediately?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” answered Lester. “Where
could we go and what could we do if we were to
desert now? We could not sleep out of doors
with the thermometer below zero, for we would
freeze to death. We must have warm weather for
our excursion.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Jones, reflectively. “I suppose
we shall have to wait, but I don’t like to, and
neither would you if you knew what we’ve got
to go through with before the ice is all out of the
river. The other objection is, that we have no one
among us who can manage the yacht after we capture
it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the reason we haven’t?”</p>

<p>“Can you do it?”</p>

<p>“I might. I have taken my own yacht in a
pleasure cruise around the great lakes from Oswego
to Duluth,” replied Lester, with unblushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
mendacity. “It was while I was in Michigan
that I killed some of those bears.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had ever killed any,” said
Jones, opening his eyes in amazement.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have. They are also abundant in
Mississippi, and one day I kept one of them from
chewing up Don Gordon.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so. You and Kenyon ought to
be chums; there he is,” said Jones, directing Lester’s
attention to a tall, lank young fellow who
looked a great deal more like a backwoodsman
than he did like a soldier. “He is from Michigan.
His father is a lumberman, and Sam had never
been out of the woods until a year ago, when he
was sent to this school to have a little polish put
on him. But he is one of the good little boys. He
says he came here to learn and has no time to fool
away. Shall I introduce you?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” said Lester, hastily. He did
not think it would be quite safe. If his friend
Jones made him known to Kenyon as a renowned
bear-hunter, the latter might go at him in much
the same style that Huggins did, and then there
would be another exposure. He could not afford
to be caught in many more lies if he hoped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
make himself a leader among his companions.
“Since Kenyon is one of the good boys, I have no
desire to become acquainted with him,” he added.
“And, while I think of it, Jones, don’t repeat
what I said to you.”</p>

<p>“About the bears? I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Because, if you do, the fellows will say I am
trying to make myself out to be somebody, and
that wouldn’t be pleasant. After I have been
here awhile they will be able to form their own
opinion of me.”</p>

<p>“They will do that just as soon as I tell them
about this plan of yours,” said Jones. “They’ll
say you are the boy they have been waiting for.
But you will take command of the yacht, after we
get her, will you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ll do that.”</p>

<p>“It is nothing more than fair that you should
have the post of honor, for you proposed it. I
will talk the matter up among the fellows before I
am an hour older.”</p>

<p>“Just one word more,” said Lester, as Jones
was about to move off. “My room-mate is going
to desert and go to sea. If I will make you acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with him, will you point out to him the
boys who will help him?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to do it,” said Jones, readily.
“But tell him to keep his own counsel until I can
have a talk with him. If he should happen to
drop a hint of what he intends to do in the presence
of some boys whose names I could mention,
they would carry it straight to the superintendent,
and then Huggins would find himself in a box.”</p>

<p>“If he runs away, will they try to catch him?”
asked Lester.</p>

<p>“To be sure they will. Squads of men will be
sent out in every direction, and some of them will
catch him too, unless he’s pretty smart. Tell him
particularly to look out for Captain Mack. He’s
the worst one in the lot. He can follow a trail
with all the certainty of a hound, and no deserter
except Don Gordon ever succeeded in giving him
the slip. Now you take a walk about the grounds,
and I will see what my friends think about this
yacht business. I will see you again in fifteen or
twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>So saying Jones walked off to join his companions,
while Lester strolled slowly toward the gate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
The latter was highly gratified by the promptness
with which his idea (Huggins’s idea, rather) had
been indorsed, but he wished he had not said so
much about his ability to manage the yacht. He
knew as much about sailing as he did about shooting
and fishing, that is, nothing at all. He had
never seen a pleasure-boat larger than Don Gordon’s.
If anybody had put a sail into a skiff and
told him it was a yacht, Lester would not have
known the difference.</p>

<p>“It isn’t at all likely that my plan will amount
to anything,” said Lester, to himself. “I suggested
it just because I wanted the fellows to
know that there are those in the world who are
fully as brave as Don Gordon is supposed to be.
But if Jones and his crowd should take me at my
word, wouldn’t I be in a fix? What in the name
of wonder would I do?”</p>

<p>It was evident that Lester was sadly mistaken
in the boys with whom he had to deal, and he
received another convincing proof of it before half
an hour had passed. By the time he had taken a
dozen turns up and down the long path, he saw
Jones and Enoch Williams hurrying to meet him.
The expression on their faces told him that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had what they considered to be good news to communicate.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Brigham,” said Jones, in a gleeful
voice. “The boys are in for it, as I told you
they would be, and desired us to say to you that
you could not have hit upon anything that would
suit them better. I have been counting noses, and
have so far found fifteen good fellows upon whom
you can call for help any time you want it. They all
agreed with me when I suggested that you ought
to have the management of the whole affair.”</p>

<p>“Where did you learn yachting, Brigham?”
asked Enoch.</p>

<p>“On the lakes,” replied Lester.</p>

<p>“Then you must be posted. I have heard that
they have some hard storms up there occasionally.”</p>

<p>“You may safely say that. It is almost always
rough off Saginaw bay,” answered Lester; and
that was true, but he did not know it by experience.
He had heard somebody say so.</p>

<p>“I am something of a yachtsman myself,” continued
Enoch. “I brought my little schooner
from Great South Bay, Long Island, around into
Chesapeake bay. Of course my father laid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
course for me, and kept his weather eye open to
see that I didn’t make any mistakes; but I gave
the orders myself, and handled the vessel.”</p>

<p>Lester, who had been on the point of entertaining
his two friends by telling of some thrilling adventures
that had befallen him during his imaginary
cruise from Oswego to Duluth, opened his
eyes and closed his lips when he heard this. He
saw that his chances for making a hero of himself
were growing smaller every hour. He was afraid
to talk about fishing in the presence of his room-mate;
he dared not speak of bears while he was
in the hearing of Sam Kenyon; and it would not
be at all safe for him to enlarge upon his knowledge
of seamanship, for here was a boy at his
elbow who had sailed his own yacht on deep
water. He was doomed to remain in the background,
and to be of no more consequence at the
academy than any other plebe. He could see that
very plainly.</p>

<p>“There’s a splendid little boat down there near
the wharf,” continued Enoch, who was as deeply
in love with the water and everything connected
with it as Huggins was, although he had no desire
to go before the mast. “I bribed her keeper to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
let me take a look at her the other day, and I tell
you her appointments are perfect. I should say
that her cabin and forecastle would accommodate
about twenty boys. But this is cutter-rigged, and
I don’t know anything about vessels of that sort;
do you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen lots of them,” answered Lester.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have; but did you ever handle
one?”</p>

<p>Lester replied that his own boat was a cutter;
and when he said it, he had as clear an idea of
what he was talking about as he had of the Greek
language.</p>

<p>“Then we are all right,” said Enoch. “They
look top-heavy to me, and I shouldn’t care to
trust myself out in one during a gale, unless there
was a sailor-man in charge of her. But if we get
her and find that she is too much for us, we can
send the yard down and make a sloop of her. It
wouldn’t pay to have her capsize with us.”</p>

<p>Lester shuddered at the mere mention of such a
thing; and while Enoch continued to talk in this
way, filling his sentences full of nautical terms, that
were familiar enough to him and quite unintelligible
to Lester, the latter set his wits at work to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
conjure up some excuse for backing out when the
critical time came. He was not at all fond of the
water, he was afraid to run the risk of capture and
punishment, and he sincerely hoped that something
would happen to prevent the proposed excursion.</p>

<p>“Of course we can’t decide upon the details
until the time for action arrives,” said Jones, at
length. “But you have given us something to
think of and to look forward to, and we are indebted
to you for that. Now, let’s call upon your
room-mate and see what we can do to help him.”</p>

<p>Lester led the way to his dormitory, and as he
opened the door rather suddenly, he and his companion
surprised Huggins in the act of making up
a small bundle of clothing. He was startled by
this abrupt entrance, and he must have been
frightened as well, for his face was as white as a
sheet.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Huggins,” said Lester, who at
once proceeded with the ceremony of introduction.
“You needn’t be afraid of these fellows.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” assented Jones. “We know
that you intend to take French leave, but it is all
right, and if there is any way in which we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
help you, we hope you will not hesitate to
say so.”</p>

<p>Huggins did not seem to be fully reassured by
these words. The pallor did not leave his face, and
the visitors noticed that he trembled as he seated
himself on the edge of his bed.</p>

<p>“I am obliged to you, but I don’t think I shall
need any assistance. This will see me through
the lines, will it not?” said Huggins, pulling from
his pocket a piece of paper on which was written
an order for all guards and patrols to pass private
Albert Huggins until half-past nine o’clock. The
printed heading showed that it was genuine.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all you need to take you by the
guards,” said Jones. “And when half-past nine
comes, you will be a long way from here, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I shall be as far off as my feet can carry me
by that time,” replied Huggins. “But don’t tell
any one which way I have gone, will you?”</p>

<p>“If you were better acquainted with us you
would know that your caution is entirely unnecessary,”
said Jones. “But you are not going to
walk two hundred miles, are you? Why don’t
you go by rail?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“How can I when I have no money?”</p>

<p>“Are you strapped?” exclaimed Enoch. “I
can spare you a dollar.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you another,” said Jones, looking at
Lester.</p>

<p>“I’ll—I’ll give another,” said the latter; but
he uttered the words with the greatest reluctance.
He was always ready to spend money, but he
wanted to know, before he parted with it, that it
was going to bring him some pleasure in return.
As he spoke he made a step toward his trunk, but
Huggins earnestly, almost vehemently, motioned
him back.</p>

<p>“No, no, boys,” said he, “I’ll not take a cent
from any of you. I am used to roughing it, and
I shall get through all right. All I ask of you is
to keep away so as not to direct attention to me.
How soon will my absence be discovered?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon the floor-guard,” answered
Jones. “If he is one of those sneaking fellows
who is forever sticking his nose into business that
does not concern him, he will report your absence
to the officer of the guard when he makes his
rounds at half-past nine. If the floor-guard keeps
his mouth shut, no one will know you are gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
until the morning roll is called. In any event no
effort will be made to find you until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And then I may expect to be pursued, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You may; and if you are not caught, it will
be a wonder. Every effort will be made to capture
you, for don’t you see that if you were permitted
to escape, other boys would be encouraged
to take French leave in the same way? Now,
listen to me, and I will give you some advice that
may be of use to you.”</p>

<p>If his advice, which was given with the most
friendly intentions, had been favorably received,
Jones would have said a good deal more than he
did; but he very soon became aware that his
words of warning were falling on deaf ears. Huggins
was not listening to him. He was unaccountably
nervous and excited, and Jones, believing
that he would be better pleased by their absence
than he was with their company, gave the signal
for leaving by picking up his cap. He lingered
long enough to shake hands with Huggins and
wish him good luck in outwitting his pursuers and
finding a vessel, and then he went out, followed
by Enoch and Lester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“How strangely he acted!” said the latter.</p>

<p>“Didn’t he?” exclaimed Enoch. “He seemed
frightened at our offer to give him a few dollars
to help him along. What was there wrong in
that? If I had been in his place I would not
have refused. Now he can take his choice between
begging his food and going hungry.”</p>

<p>“I don’t envy him his long, cold walk,” observed
Jones. “And where is he going to find a bed
when night comes? The people in this country
don’t like tramps any too well, and the first time
he stops at a farm-house he may be interviewed by
a bull-dog.”</p>

<p>Lester did not find an opportunity to talk with
his room-mate again that day. They marched
down to supper together, and as soon as the ranks
were broken, Huggins made all haste to put on his
hat and overcoat, secure his bundle and quit the
room. He would hardly wait to say good-by to
Lester, and didn’t want the latter to go with him
as far as the gate.</p>

<p>“He’s well out of his troubles, and mine are
just about to begin,” thought Lester, as he stood
on the front steps and saw Huggins disappear in
the darkness. “I would run away myself if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
were not afraid of the consequences. It wouldn’t
be safe to try father’s patience too severely, for
there is no telling what he would do to me.”</p>

<p>Lester strolled about until the bugle sounded
“to quarters,” and then he went up to his room,
where he passed a very lonely evening. No one
dared to come near him, and if he had attempted
to leave his room, he would have been ordered back
by the floor-guard. He knew he ought to study,
but still he would not do it. It would be time
enough, he thought, to take up his books, when
he could see no way to get out of it.</p>

<p>Lester went to bed long before taps, and slept
soundly until he was aroused by the report of the
morning gun, and the noise of the fifes and
drums in the drill-room. Having been told that
he would have just six minutes in which to dress,
he got into his clothes without loss of time, and
fell into the ranks just as the last strains of the
morning call died away.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">FLIGHT AND PURSUIT.</span></h2>

<p>“Fourth company. All present or accounted
for with the exception of Private Albert
Huggins,” said Bert Gordon, as he faced about
and raised his hand to his cap.</p>

<p>“Where is Private Huggins?” demanded Captain
Clayton.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. He had a pass last night,
and he seems to have abused it. At any rate he
is not in the ranks to answer to his name.”</p>

<p>Captain Clayton reported to the adjutant, who
in turn reported to the officer of the day, and then
the ranks were broken, and the young soldiers hurried
to their dormitories to wash their hands and
faces, comb their hair, and get ready for morning
inspection. While Bert and his room-mate were
thus engaged, an orderly opened the door long
enough to say that Sergeant Gordon was wanted in
the superintendent’s office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hallo!” exclaimed Sergeant Elmer—that was
the name and rank of Bert’s room-mate—“you
are going out after Huggins, most likely. If you
have the making up of the detail don’t forget me.”</p>

<p>Bert said he wouldn’t, and hastened out to obey
the summons. As he was passing along the hall
he was suddenly confronted by Lester Brigham,
who jerked open the door of his room and shouted
“Police! Police!” at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” exclaimed
Bert, wondering if Lester had taken leave of his
senses.</p>

<p>“I’ve been robbed!” cried Lester, striding up
and down the floor, in spite of all Bert could do to
quiet him. “That villain Huggins broke open my
trunk and took a clean hundred dollars in money
out of it.”</p>

<p>Lester’s wild cries had alarmed everybody on
that floor, and the hall was rapidly filling with
students who ran out of their rooms to see what
was the matter.</p>

<p>“Go back, boys,” commanded Bert. “You
have not a moment to waste. If your rooms are
not ready for inspection you will be reported and
punished for it. Go back, every one of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>He emphasized this order by pulling out his
note-book and holding his pencil in readiness to
write down the name of every student who did not
yield prompt obedience. The boys scattered in
every direction, and when the hall was cleared,
Bert seized Lester by the arm and pulled him into
his room.</p>

<p>“No yelling now,” said he sternly.</p>

<p>“Must I stand by and let somebody rob
me without saying a word?” vociferated Lester.</p>

<p>“By no means; but you can act like a sane boy
and report the matter in a quiet way, can’t you?
Now explain, and be quick about it, for the superintendent
wants to see me.”</p>

<p>“Why, Huggins has run away—he intended to
do it when he got that pass last night—and he has
taken every dollar I had in the world to help himself
along. Just look here,” said Lester, picking
up the hasp of his trunk which had been broken in
two in the middle. “Huggins did that yesterday,
and I never knew it until a few minutes ago. I
went to my trunk to get out a clean collar, and
then I found that the hasp was broken, and that
my clothes were tumbled about in the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
confusion. I looked for my money the first thing,
but it was gone.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that it is against the rules
for a student to have more than five dollars in his
possession at one time?” asked Bert. “If you
had lived up to the law and given your money into
the superintendent’s keeping, you would not have
lost it.”</p>

<p>“What do I care for the law?” snarled
Lester.</p>

<p>“You ought to care for it. If you didn’t intend
to obey it, you had no business to sign the muster-roll.”</p>

<p>“Well, who’s going to get my hundred dollars
back for me? That’s what I want to know,”
cried Lester, who showed signs of going off into
another flurry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that any one can get it back for
you,” said Bert quietly. “It is possible that you
may never see it again.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll see some more just like it, you may
depend upon that,” said Lester, walking nervously
up and down the floor and shaking his fists in the
air. “I was robbed in the superintendent’s house,
and he is bound to make my loss good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s where you are mistaken. You took
your own risk by disobeying the rules——”</p>

<p>“The money was mine and the superintendent
had no more right to touch it than you had,”
interrupted Lester. “My father gave it to me
with his own hands, because he wanted I should
have a fund by me that I could draw on without
asking anybody’s permission.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see what you made by it, don’t
you? How do you know that Huggins has run
away?”</p>

<p>“He told me he was going to. I offered to give
him a dollar to help him along, and so did Jones
and Williams.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to have done that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care; I did it, and this is the way he
repaid me. I’ll bet he had my money in his
pocket when he refused my offer. I thought he
acted queer, and so did the other boys.”</p>

<p>“Do you know which way he intended to go?”</p>

<p>“He said he was going to draw a bee-line for
Oxford, and ship on the first vessel he could find
that would take him to sea. Are you going after
him?” inquired Lester, as Bert turned toward
the door. “Look here: if you will follow him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
up and get my money back for me, I’ll—I’ll lend
you five dollars of it, if you want it.”</p>

<p>Lester was about to say that he would <i>give</i> Bert
that amount, but he caught his breath in time,
and saved five dollars by it. He knew very well
that Bert would never be obliged to ask him for
money.</p>

<p>The sergeant hurried down to the superintendent’s
office, where he found the officer of the day,
who had just been making his report.</p>

<p>“I understand that Private Huggins abused my
confidence, and that he stayed out all night on the
pass I gave him yesterday,” said the superintendent,
after returning Bert’s salute. “Perhaps
you had better take a corporal with you, and look
around and see if you can find any traces of him.”</p>

<p>Bert was delighted. Here was an opportunity
for him to win a reputation.</p>

<p>“Shall I go to Oxford, sir?” said he.</p>

<p>“To Oxford?” repeated the superintendent,
while the officer of the day looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. There’s where he has gone.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“His room-mate told me so. He has run away
intending to go to sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, well! It is more serious than I thought,”
said the superintendent, while an expression of
annoyance and vexation settled on his face. “He
must be brought back. Was he going to walk all
that distance or steal a ride on the cars? He has
no money, and his father took pains to tell me
that none would be allowed him.”</p>

<p>“He has plenty of it, sir,” replied Bert. “He
broke into Private Brigham’s trunk and took a
hundred dollars from it.”</p>

<p>The superintendent could hardly believe that he
had heard aright.</p>

<p>“That is the most disgraceful thing that ever
happened in this school,” said he, as soon as he
could speak. “I didn’t suppose there was a boy
here who could be guilty of an act of that kind.
Sergeant,” he added, looking at his watch,
“you have just fifteen minutes in which to
reach the depot and ascertain whether or not
Huggins took the eight o’clock train for Oxford
last night. Learn all you can, and go with the
squad which I shall at once send in pursuit of
him.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” replied Bert.</p>

<p>“Can I go?” asked Sergeant Elmer, as Bert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
ran into his room and snatched his overcoat and
cap from their hooks.</p>

<p>“I hope so, but I am afraid not. The superintendent
will make up the detail himself or appoint
some shoulder-strap to do it, and it isn’t likely
that he will take two sergeants from the same
company. You will have to act in my place while
I am gone.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-by and good luck to you,” said
the disappointed Elmer.</p>

<p>Bert hastened down the stairs and out of the
building, and at the gate he found the officer of
the day who had come there to pass him by the
sentry. As soon as he had closed the gate behind
him, he broke into a run, and in a few minutes
more he was walking back and forth in front of
the ticket-office, conversing with a quiet looking
man who was to be found there whenever a train
passed the depot. He was a detective.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Shepard,” said Bert.
“Were you on duty when No. 6 went down last
night?”</p>

<p>No. 6 was the first southward bound train that
passed through Bridgeport after Huggins left the
academy grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was,” answered the detective. “Was that
fellow I came pretty near running in last night on
general principles one of your boys?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell until you describe him,” said Bert.</p>

<p>“There was nothing wrong about his appearance,
but I didn’t like the way he acted,” observed
the detective. “He looked as though he had
been up to something. He didn’t buy a ticket,
and he took pains to board the train from the opposite
side. He wore a dark-blue overcoat, Arctic
shoes, seal-skin cap, gloves and muffler, and had
something on his upper lip that looked like a streak
of free-soil, but which, perhaps, on closer examination
might have proved to be a mustache.”</p>

<p>“That’s the fellow,” said Bert. “Did he go toward
Oxford?”</p>

<p>“He did. Do you want him? What has he
been doing?”</p>

<p>“I do want him, for he is a deserter,” replied
Bert. He said nothing about the crime of which
Huggins was guilty. The superintendent had not
told him to keep silent in regard to it, but he knew
he was expected to do it all the same.</p>

<p>“Then I am glad I didn’t run him in,” said Mr.
Shepard. “You boys always see plenty of fun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
when you are out after deserters. But you can’t
take that big fellow alone. He’ll pick you up and
chuck you head first into a snow-drift.”</p>

<p>“There are one or two fellows in that squad whom
he can’t chuck into a snow-drift,” said Bert, pointing
with his thumb over his shoulder toward the door.</p>

<p>The detective looked, and saw a party of students
coming into the depot at double time. They
were led by Captain (formerly Corporal) Mack,
who, having been permitted to choose his own
men, had detailed Curtis, Egan, Hopkins, and
Don Gordon to form his squad. A long way behind
them came the old German professor, Mr.
Odenheimer, who was very red in the face and
puffing and blowing like a porpoise. The fleet-footed
boys had led him a lively race, and they
meant to do it, too. They didn’t want him along,
for his presence was calculated to rob them of
much of the pleasure they would otherwise have
enjoyed. He was jolly and good-natured when off
duty, but still pompous and rather overbearing,
and if Huggins were captured and Lester Brigham’s
money returned to him, the honor of the
achievement would fall to him, and not to Captain
Mack and his men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Young sheltemans,” panted the professor,
stopping in front of the squad which Captain
Mack had halted and brought to a front preparatory
to breaking ranks,“I use to could go double
quick so good like de pest of you ven I vas in
mine good Brussia fighting mit unser Fritz; but
I peen not a good boy for running not now any
more. Vere is Sergeant Gordon?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” replied Bert, stepping up and saluting.</p>

<p>“Vell, vere ish dat young rascals—vat you call
him—Hukkins?”</p>

<p>“He has gone to Oxford, sir,” said Bert, who
then went on to repeat the substance of his conversation
with the detective. Now and then his
eyes wandered toward the boys in the ranks, who
came so near making him laugh in the professor’s
face that he was obliged to turn his back toward
them. They were indulging in all sorts of pranks
calculated to show their utter disapproval of the
whole proceeding. Don was humped up like old
Jordan, the negro he had so often personated;
Hopkins was mimicking the professor; Egan, who
had assumed a very wise expression of countenance,
was checking off Bert’s remarks on his fingers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Curtis was watching for a chance to snatch
an apple from the stand behind him; while Captain
Mack held himself in readiness to drop a piece
of ice down his back the very moment he attempted
it. These boys all liked the professor in spite
of his pomposity and his constant allusions to his
military record, but they would have been much
better satisfied if he had remained at the academy.
If they had taken time to consider the matter,
they would have seen very clearly that the superintendent
had acted for the best, and that he
would not have showed any degree of prudence if
he had left them to pursue and capture the deserter
alone and unaided. There was no play
about this, and besides Huggins was something
worse than a deserter.</p>

<p>Just then the whistle of an approaching train
was heard; whereupon Captain Mack was ordered
to break ranks and procure tickets for himself and
his party, Bert included. This done they boarded
the cars, and in a few minutes more were speeding
away toward Oxford.</p>

<p>“I don’t at all like this way of doing business,”
observed Captain Mack, who occupied a seat with
Bert. “I am not personally acquainted with Huggins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
but if there is any faith to be put in his
appearance, he is nobody’s fool. He’ll not go to
Oxford after stealing that money. If he went this
way, he will stop off at some little station, buy
another suit of clothes and keep dark until he
thinks the matter has had time to blow over.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better say as much to the
professor,” suggested Bert.</p>

<p>“Not I!” replied Captain Mack, with a laugh
and a knowing shake of his head. “I have no
desire to give him a chance to turn his battery of
broken English loose on me. He has done it too
many times already. While I am very anxious that
Huggins should be caught and the money recovered,
I can see as much fun in riding about the
country as I can in drilling; and if the professor
wants to spend a week or two on a wild-goose
chase, it is nothing to me. I put in some good
solid time with my books last vacation, and I am
three months ahead of my class.”</p>

<p>The captain was right when he said that Huggins
did not look like anybody’s fool, and he wasn’t,
either. When he first made up his mind to desert
the academy, he laid his plans just as he told them
to Lester Brigham; but one morning an incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
occurred that caused him to make a slight change
in them. He saw Lester go to his trunk and take a
five-dollar bill from a well-filled pocket-book which
he kept hidden under his clothing. The sight of
it suggested an idea to Huggins—one that frightened
him at first, but after he had pondered upon
it for a while and dreamed about it a few times, it
became familiar to him, and he ceased to look
upon it as a crime.</p>

<p>“It is easier to ride than it is to walk,” he often
said to himself. “Lester doesn’t need the money,
and I do, for I don’t know what I shall have to go
through with before I can find a vessel. Oxford is
a small place, and I may have to stay there a week
or two before I can secure a berth, and how could
I live all that time without money? I am not
going to steal it—I shall borrow it, for, of course,
my father will refund every cent of it. I know he
will not like to do it, but he ought to have let me
go to sea when I asked him.”</p>

<p>After reasoning with himself in this way a few
times, Huggins finally mustered up courage enough
to make himself the possessor of the coveted
pocket-book. Unfortunately, opportunities were
not wanting. Lester was hardly ever in his room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
during the day-time, and it was an easy matter for
Huggins to lock the door and break open the trunk
with the aid of a spike he had picked up in the
carpenter-shop. Then he bundled up some of his
clothes, intending to ask for a pass and leave the
academy at once. He got the pass, as we know,
but found, to his great surprise and alarm, that
he could not use it until after supper. It was no
wonder that he showed nervousness and anxiety
when Jones and the rest offered to lend him money
to help him along. If he had not succeeded in
satisfying them that he would not accept assistance
from them, and Lester had gone to his trunk
after the dollar, there would have been trouble
directly. He escaped this danger, however, and
as soon as he could use his pass, he made all haste
to get out of Bridgeport.</p>

<p>“But I’ll not go to Oxford yet,” said he, when
he found himself safe on board the cars. “The
fellows said they wouldn’t tell where I intended to
go, but when they made that promise they didn’t
know that I had borrowed Brigham’s money.”</p>

<p>Just then the conductor tapped him on the
shoulder and held out his hand for the boy’s
ticket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is the fare to the next station?” asked
the latter.</p>

<p>“One twenty-five,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Huggins produced the money, and then buttoned
his overcoat, settled back into an easy position on
his seat, and tried to make up his mind what he
should do next. Before he had come to any decision
on this point, the whistle blew again, and the train
came to a stop; whereupon Huggins picked up his
bundle, which he had carried under his coat when
he deserted the academy, and left the car. The few
men he saw upon the platform were running about
as if they were very busy—all except one, who
strolled around with his hands in his pockets.
Huggins drew back out of the glare of the lamps
that were shining from the windows of the depot,
to wait for an opportunity to speak to him. He
had got off at a tank-station, but he did not find
it out until it was too late to go farther.</p>

<p>Having taken on a fresh supply of coal and
water the engine moved off, dragging its long train
of sleeping-cars behind it, the station agent went
into his office, closing the door behind him, and
Huggins and the unemployed stranger were left
alone on the platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good evening to you, pard,” said the latter,
walking up to the boy’s place of concealment.</p>

<p>“How are you?” replied Huggins, who did not
like the familiar tone in which he had been addressed.
“Can you tell me which way to go to
find a hotel?”</p>

<p>“Hotel!” repeated the stranger. “There’s
none around here.”</p>

<p>Huggins started and looked about him. Then
he saw that he had got off in the woods, and that
there were only one or two small buildings within
the range of his vision.</p>

<p>“Is there no house in the neighborhood at
which I can obtain a night’s lodging?” asked
Huggins, growing alarmed.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there is,” was the encouraging
reply.</p>

<p>“Where does the station-agent sleep?”</p>

<p>“In his office.”</p>

<p>“How far is your house from here?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say just how many miles it is.”</p>

<p>“What is your business?” asked Huggins, growing
suspicious of the stranger.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any just now. I am a minister’s
son, traveling for my health. I’ll tell you what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
we might do, pard: if you are a good talker
you might coax the agent to let us spend the
night in the waiting-room. There’s a good fire
there——”</p>

<p>Huggins waited to hear no more. The man
was a professional tramp, there was no doubt
about that, and the idea of passing the night in
the same room with him was not to be entertained
for a moment. He started for the office to have a
talk with the agent, the tramp keeping close at
his heels.</p>

<p>“I made a mistake in getting off here,” said
Huggins to the agent, “and I would be greatly
obliged if you will direct me to some house where
I can put up until morning.”</p>

<p>“I should be glad to do it,” was the answer,
“but there is no one right around the depot who
can accommodate you. There is a boarding-house
for the mill-hands about a mile from here, but I
couldn’t direct you to it so that you could find it.
The road runs through the woods, and you might
miss it and get lost.”</p>

<p>“Why, what in the world am I to do?” asked
Huggins, who, having never been thrown upon his
own resources before, was as helpless as a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
would have been in the same situation. “Must I
stay out doors all night?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“I came from Bridgeport and paid a dollar and
twenty-five cents to go from there to the next
station.”</p>

<p>“Well, the next station is Carbondale, which is
three miles from here. There is where you ought
to have stopped.”</p>

<p>“Could I hire a horse and cutter to take me
there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you could.”</p>

<p>“I am able and willing to pay liberally
for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you would have to go out to the mills to
find a horse and a man to drive it for you, and
you might as well walk to Carbondale at once as
to do that.”</p>

<p>“When is the next train due?”</p>

<p>“The next train won’t help you any, for it is
the lightning express, and she doesn’t stop here.
You can’t go on the next one either, for she is the
fast freight, and doesn’t carry passengers. You’ll
have to wait for the accommodation which goes
through here at six fourteen in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I suppose I shall have to pass the night
in your waiting-room,” said Huggins, who was
fairly at his wits’ end.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you won’t,” said the agent in
emphatic tones. “I shall have to ask you to go
out now, for I am going to lock up.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you leave a room open for the accommodation
of passengers?” exclaimed Huggins,
wondering what would become of him if the agent
turned him out in the snow to pass the night as
best he could, while the thermometer was only a
degree or two above zero. If it had been summer
he could have bunked under a tree; but as it was—the
runaway shuddered when he thought of the
long, cold hours that must be passed in some way
before he would see the sun rise again. Here the
tramp, who stood holding his hands over the
stove, put in a word to help Huggins; but he only
made a bad matter worse. The heart of the station
agent was not likely to be moved to pity by
any such advocate as he was. He carried a very
hard-looking face, he was rough and unkempt,
and his whole appearance was against him. Besides,
he did not speak in a way calculated to
carry his point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see what harm it will do for us to sit
by your fire,” said he, in angry tones.</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether you see any harm in it
or not,” said the agent, taking a bunch of keys
from his pocket. “I know what my orders are,
and I intend to obey them. Come now, move;
both of you.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me what to do,” said
Huggins, as he turned toward the door. “I am
not in this man’s company, and neither am I
interceding for him. I am speaking for myself
alone.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that. If I let you in I must let
him in too; but my orders are to turn everybody
out when I lock up. The best thing you can do
is to strike out for Carbondale at your best pace.
The night is clear, and you can’t miss the way if
you follow the railroad. There are no bridges or
trestle-works for you to cross, and no cattle-guards
to fall into. If you make haste, you can get there
before the hotels shut up. Go on, now!”</p>

<p>The agent arose from his chair as he said this,
and Huggins and the tramp opened the door and
went out into the cold.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">DON’S ENCOUNTER WITH THE TRAMP.</span></h2>

<p>“You’re not in my company, ain’t you? You
didn’t speak for me but for yourself, did
you? You think you’re too fine a gentleman to be
seen loafing about with such a fellow as I am,
don’t you?” growled the tramp, when he and
Huggins were alone on the platform. “I’ve the
best notion in the world to make you pay for them
words, and I will, too, if I find you hanging
about here after the agent has gone to bed.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the man was in earnest
when he said this. The light from the agent’s window
shone full upon his face and the runaway
could see that there was an evil look in it.</p>

<p>“If you had stood by me I would have given
you a good place to sleep, for I know where there
is a nice warm hay-mow with plenty of blankets
and buffalo robes to put over you,” continued the
tramp. “I slept there last night, and I’m going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
there now, after I see you start for Carbondale.
Go on, be off with you!”</p>

<p>“I’m not going there,” replied Huggins, who
was so badly frightened by the man’s vehemence
that he was afraid to show any of the indignation
he felt at being ordered about in this unceremonious
way. “I shall stay right here on this platform
until daylight.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t. I’m not going to have you
staying around here watching for a chance to follow
me to my warm bed. You went back on me,
and now you can look out for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of following you,” said
Huggins.</p>

<p>“I’ll believe that when I see you dig out for
Carbondale. Go on, I say, or I’ll help you!”</p>

<p>The man took his hands out of his pockets, and
Huggins believing that he was about to put his
threat into execution, jumped off the platform,
and started up the railroad track at a rapid pace,
the tramp standing in the full glare of the light
from the agent’s window, and keeping a close
watch over his movements.</p>

<p>“That was a pretty good idea,” said he to himself,
as he saw the boy’s figure growing dim in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
distance. “He said he was able and willing to
pay liberal for somebody to take him to Carbondale,
and that proves that he’s got money. I’ll
just look into that matter when he gets a little
farther away. I’ll take that fine cap, muffler,
and them gloves of his’n, too. They’ll keep me
warm while I have ’em, and I can trade ’em
off or sell ’em before the police can get wind of
me.”</p>

<p>So saying the man stepped down from the platform
and moved leisurely up the track in the direction
in which Huggins had disappeared, shuffling
along in a supremely lazy and disjointed way,
that no one ever saw imitated by anybody except
a professional tramp.</p>

<p>“The insolent fellow!” thought Huggins, looking
back now and then to make sure that the man
was still standing on the platform. “What right
had he to tell me to go on to Carbondale if I
wanted to stay at the depot until morning? He
must think I am hard up for a night’s rest if he
imagines that I would be willing to sleep in a hay-mow.
I’ll have a good bed while I am about it,
for now that I am on the road to Carbondale, I
shall keep moving until I get there. How lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and still it is out here, and how gloomy the woods
look! I wish I had somebody to talk to.”</p>

<p>When the darkness had shut the station-house,
the tank, the upright, motionless figure of the
tramp and every thing else except the light in
the agent’s window out from his view, Huggins
broke into a run, and flew along the track at the
top of his speed. He kept up the pace as long
as he could stand it, and then settled down into a
rapid trot which carried him easily over one of the
three miles he had to cover before he could find a
roof to shelter him and a bed to sleep in.</p>

<p>“I think I am all right now,” soliloquized the
runaway, slackening his pace to a walk and unbuttoning
his heavy muffler, which felt too warm
about his neck. “I tell you I am glad to see the
last of that tramp, for I didn’t at all like the looks
of him. I believe he’d just as soon——”</p>

<p>The runaway’s heart seemed to stop beating. He
faced quickly about, and there was the tramp
whom he hoped he had seen for the last time,
close behind him. He had easily kept pace with
the boy, stepping so exactly in time with him that
the sound of his feet upon the frosty snow had
not betrayed his presence. He held some object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in his hand which he flourished over his head, and
Huggins, believing it to be a pistol, stood trembling
in his tracks and waited for him to come up.
The object was not a pistol, but it was a murderous
looking knife, which made the boy shudder all
over as he looked at it.</p>

<p>“I’ve concluded to make you pay for going back
on me so fair and square while you were talking to
the agent,” were the tramp’s next words. “Put
your hands above your head while I go through
your pockets and see what you’ve got in ’em.”</p>

<p>“Do you want my money?” asked Huggins,
who could hardly make himself understood, so
frightened was he. “If you do I will give it to
you, but don’t hurt me.”</p>

<p>He carried his money in two places. The greater
portion of it was in Lester Brigham’s pocket-book;
and in one of his vest pockets he had the small
amount of change the conductor gave him when
he paid his fare. As it was all in small bills and
made a roll of respectable size, he hoped he could
satisfy the robber by handing it over, but he was
doomed to be disappointed. When he made a
move as if he were about to unbutton his overcoat,
the man raised his knife threateningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“None o’ that!” said he, in savage tones.
“You can’t draw a barker on me while I am
within reach of you, and it will be worse for you
if you try it. Put your hands above your head,
and be quick about it.”</p>

<p>Huggins was afraid to refuse or to utter a word of
remonstrance. He raised his hands in the air, and
the robber, after dropping the knife into his coat-pocket,
so that it could be readily seized if circumstances
should seem to require it, proceeded
to “go through” him in the most business-like
way. He turned all the boy’s pockets inside out,
and when he had completed his investigations,
Huggins’s money was all gone and he stood shivering
in the tramp’s hat and thread-bare coat, while the
tramp himself looked like another person. He had
appropriated the runaway’s cap, coats, muffler and
gloves, and would have taken his boots and Arctics
too, if they had been big enough for him.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said he, as he buttoned the
muffler about his neck and drew on the gloves, “I
believe I am done with you, and you can dig out.”</p>

<p>“But where can I go?” cried Huggins. “I
have no money to pay for a night’s lodging, and I
am almost a thousand miles from home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are better off than I am, for I have no
home at all,” answered the tramp. “It won’t hurt
you to sleep out of doors; I’ve done it many a time.
Now skip, for I have wasted words enough with
you. Not that way,” he added, as Huggins reluctantly
turned his face toward Carbondale. “Go
back to the station. Step lively now, for if you
don’t, I shall be after you.”</p>

<p>The boy dared not wait for the command to be
repeated, believing, as he did, that it would be
emphasized by a prod with the knife which the
robber still held in his hand. Scarcely realizing
what he was doing he hurried along the track toward
the station, and when he ventured to look
behind him, the tramp was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“Now what am I going to do?” said Huggins
to himself; and it was a question he pondered all
the way to the station, and which he could not
answer even when daylight came. The station-agent
was just locking up as he stepped upon the
platform, and he resolved to make another effort
to obtain a seat by one of his fires.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please let me sit in the waiting-room
until morning?” said the boy, in a pleading voice.</p>

<p>“No, <i>no</i>!” was the angry response. “Clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
out! You are the third one who has asked me
that question to-night. I don’t keep a hotel. If
I did, I’d have a sign out.”</p>

<p>“That man who followed me into your office a
little while ago, has robbed me,” gasped Huggins,
choking back a sob.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say he had!” exclaimed the
agent, after he had taken a sharp look at Huggins.
“I thought I knew your voice, but I didn’t
recognize you in those clothes. If I had had the
chance I should have told you to shake him as
soon as possible. He has been hanging around
here all day, and I was afraid he would be up to
something before he left. Why didn’t you call
for help?”</p>

<p>“He was armed and savage and I was afraid to
say a word,” replied the runaway. “Besides it
would have done no good, for I was a long distance
up the track when he overtook me.”</p>

<p>“Did he take all your money?”</p>

<p>“Every red cent. He didn’t even leave me my
pocket-knife or note-book.”</p>

<p>“Your case is a hard one, that’s a fact, and I
will do what I can for you,” said the agent.
“You may sit in this room to-night. That fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
will probably go to Oxford, and if I can get the
operator there to respond to my call, I’ll tell him
to put the police on the look-out. To-morrow I
will send an alarm all along the line.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you,” said Huggins,
gratefully. “I may some day be able to repay
you for your kindness.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Good night.”</p>

<p>The agent went out, and the runaway drew one
of the chairs up in front of the stove and sat down
in it. He was provided for for the night, but
what should he do when morning came? Should
he stay there at the tank-station and look for
work, or would it be better for him to start for
Oxford on foot, begging his meals as he went like
any other tramp? That was what he intended
to do when he first made up his mind to desert
the academy, and he could not see that there was
any other course open to him now. While he was
thinking about it, he fell asleep. He did not
know when the lightning express and the fast
freight went through, but he heard the whistle of
the morning train, and hurried to the door to see
the accommodation approaching. He saw something
else, too—something that put life and energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
into him, and sent him around the corner of
the building out of sight.</p>

<p>“They are after me already,” said he, as he
hurried along a road that led from the station into
the woods. “I saw their uniform caps sticking
out of the window.”</p>

<p>If he had waited a few minutes longer he would
have seen Captain Mack and Sergeant Gordon
step upon the platform and run toward the agent’s
office.</p>

<p>“Did you say he was a tall young fellow with a
little mustache, and that he wore a dark-blue
overcoat, Arctic shoes and seal-skin furs? He’s
the very chap. Come with me. He was fast
asleep in a chair in the waiting-room not more
than half an hour ago. There is his chair,” said
the agent, as he opened the door, “but he has
skipped out, as sure as the world.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea where he is?” asked the
young captain.</p>

<p>“I think he must have gone to Carbondale,”
replied the agent. “But see here, boys: you
needn’t waste any time in looking for a fellow in
a blue overcoat and seal-skin furs, for the police
will take care of him. You want to keep your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
eyes open for a chap in a patched and torn broad-cloth
coat and a slouch hat without any brim to
it. You see——”</p>

<p>Here the agent went on to tell how Huggins
had been robbed and compelled to exchange
clothes with the tramp. The boys listened attentively,
and when the agent finished his story, they
hastened back to the train to report to the professor.
Captain Mack did the talking, and wound
up with the request that he might be permitted
to take a couple of men and go up the wagon-road
toward Carbondale to see if Huggins had
gone that way. To his great surprise as well as
delight the request was granted, the professor adding
that he and the rest of the squad would keep
on with the train until he thought they had got
ahead of the runaway, and then they would get
off and come back on foot.</p>

<p>“If you seen any dings of Hukkins or de veller
vot robbed him, you will gatch all two of dem
and rebort to me py delegraph,” said the professor,
in concluding his instructions. “I shall pe
somveres along de road, and as lightning can
dravel so much fasder dan shteam, you can easy
gatch me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very good, sir. I wish I could take you with
me, Bert,” he added, in a whisper, “for I am
bound to carry off the honors of this scout; but
you will have to stay and act as lackey to the
professor. Gordon, you and Egan come with
me.”</p>

<p>The boys obeyed with alacrity, smiling and
kissing their hands to Hopkins and Curtis, who
frowned fiercely and shook their fists at them in
return. They stood upon the platform until the
train moved off, and then Captain Mack said:</p>

<p>“Business before pleasure, boys. I move that
we go somewhere and get a good, old-fashioned
country breakfast. I speak for a big bowl of
bread and milk.”</p>

<p>The others were only too glad to fall in with
this proposition. Having left the academy almost
as soon as they got up, they began to feel the
cravings of hunger, and their appetites were
sharpened by the mere mention of bread and milk.
They held a short consultation with the station-agent,
and then started leisurely down the wagon
road in the direction of Carbondale, stopping at
every house along the route with the intention of
asking for a bowl of bread and milk, but always,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
for some reason or other, coming away without
doing it. They were not inclined to be fastidious.
When it came to the pinch they could eat pancakes
or bacon that were seasoned with nothing
but ashes and cinders with as much zest as anybody;
but they had become so accustomed to the
strict and rigidly enforced rules regarding personal
cleanliness, that any violation of these rules
shocked them. To quote from Don Gordon, who
generally expressed his sentiments in the plainest
possible language, they had no use for children
whose faces and hands were covered with molasses,
nor could they see anything to admire in an
unkempt woman who went about her cooking with
a well-blackened clay-pipe in her mouth.</p>

<p>“There’s the place we are looking for,” said
Egan, directing his companions’ attention to a
neat little farm-house a short distance in advance
of them. “If we can’t find a breakfast there,
we’ll not find it this side of——”</p>

<p>At that instant the front door of the house was
suddenly opened, and a lady appeared upon the
threshold. She looked anxiously up and down
the road, and, seeing the students approaching,
beckoned to them with frantic eagerness, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
same time calling out, “Help! help!” at the
top of her voice.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” cried Captain Mack. “Her
house is on fire.”</p>

<p>The officer and his men broke into a run, discarding
their heavy overcoats as they went, but
before they had made many steps they discovered
that it was something besides fire that had occasioned
the lady’s alarm. All on a sudden a back
door was jerked violently open, and a man bounded
down the steps and ran across a field toward the
railroad track.</p>

<p>“He’s been doing something in there,” shouted
Captain Mack. “Take after him, boys.”</p>

<p>“That’s one of the fellows we want,” observed
Egan. “He’s got Huggins’s overcoat on.”</p>

<p>“So he has,” said the captain. “Never mind
the lady, for she is safe now. Catch the tramp,
and we’ll find out what he had been doing to
frighten her.”</p>

<p>Don Gordon, who had already taken the lead of
his companions, cleared the high farm gate as
easily as though he had been furnished with wings,
and ran up the carriage-way. He lingered at a
wood-rack he found in front of the barn long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
enough to jerk one of the stakes out of it, and
having thus provided himself with a weapon, he
continued the pursuit.</p>

<p>The tramp, who had about fifty yards the start,
proved himself to be no mean runner. His wind
was good, his muscles had been hardened by many
a long pedestrian tour about the country, and Don
afterward admitted that for a long time it looked
as if the man were going to beat him; but when
the latter got what school-boys are wont to call
his “second wind,” he gained rapidly. Another
hundred yards run brought him almost within
striking distance of the fugitive, and while he was
trying to make up his mind whether he ought to
halt him or knock him down without ceremony to
pay him for frightening the lady, the tramp suddenly
stopped and faced about. Then Don saw
that he carried a knife in his hand.</p>

<p>“Keep away from me,” said he, in savage tones,
“or I’ll——”</p>

<p>“You’ll what?” demanded Don, leaning on his
club and casting a quick glance over his shoulder
to see how far his companions were behind.</p>

<p>“Do you see this?” said the tramp, shaking
the knife threateningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I see it,” answered Don, coolly. “You
had better throw it away. You might hurt yourself
with it.”</p>

<p>The tramp was astonished. Here was a boy
who could not be as easily frightened as Huggins
was, and he began to stand in awe of him. He
was old enough to know that a cool, deliberate
antagonist is much more to be feared than one
who allows himself to go into a paroxysm of rage
and excitement.</p>

<p>“Drop that knife,” commanded Don, who had
suddenly made up his mind that the tramp ought
to be disarmed before his companions came up;
and as he spoke, he raised his club over his
head.</p>

<p>A year’s hard drill, added to faithful attention
to the instructions he had received from Professor
Odenheimer, had made Don Gordon very proficient
in the broadsword exercise, but he had never
had an opportunity to test the value of the accomplishment
until this particular morning. Seeing
that the man had no intention of dropping the
knife he proceeded to disarm him, and he did it in
a way that was as surprising to him as it was to the
tramp. Bringing his club to the first position, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
made a feint with it as if he were going to give a
No. 1 cut. If the weapon had not been arrested
in its progress through the air, and the tramp had
stood motionless, he would have received a sounding
whack on his left cheek; but seeing the club
coming he ducked his head at the very instant
that Don changed from the first to the third cut,
thus receiving squarely between the eyes the full
force of a terrific blow that was intended for his
right forearm. He fell as if he had been shot.
The knife fell from his grasp, and before he could
recover it, Captain Mack had run up and secured
possession of it.</p>

<p>Without saying a word Egan proceeded to explore
the tramp’s pockets, and the first thing he
brought to light was Lester Brigham’s money. It
was all there, too, for the tramp had had no opportunity
to spend any of it. He had reasons of
his own for desiring to go to Oxford, but he did
not intend to start immediately. He slept in a
barn that night, and intended, as soon as he had
begged a breakfast, to strike back into the country
and make his way to Oxford by a round-about
course, avoiding the railroad and all the villages
along the route. He hoped in this way to elude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the police who, he knew, would be on the watch
for him. When he reached the farm-house from
which he had taken his hurried flight, and found
that the male members of the family were absent,
he began to act as though he had a right there.
He demanded a warm breakfast and a seat at the
table; and when the lady of the house objected
and tried to oppose his entrance into the kitchen,
he frightened her nearly out of her senses by producing
his knife and threatening to do something
terrible with it if his demands were not complied
with on the instant. Some of these things Captain
Mack and his men learned from the tramp
himself, and the rest of the story they heard from
the lady, into whose presence they conducted their
prisoner without loss of time. The latter came
very near meeting with a warm reception. The
farmer and his two stalwart sons had just come in
from the wood-lot where they had spent the morning
in chopping, and it was all the old gentleman,
aided by his wife and Captain Mack and his men,
could do to keep the boys from punching the
tramp’s head.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with him?” demanded
the farmer, when quiet had been restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and Captain Mack had told what the tramp had
done to Huggins the night before.</p>

<p>“I am going to take him back to the station
and telegraph to Professor Odenheimer for orders,”
answered the captain. “Those are my instructions.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t had any breakfast, I reckon, have
you? I thought not. Well, I haven’t either.
Come in and sit down. It’s all ready.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mack. “A bowl of milk
would be——”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got something better than that.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t anything that would suit me
better,” said Mack, with refreshing candor. “I
am a city boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ah! Well, you shall have all the milk
you can drink.”</p>

<p>When Captain Mack and his men had satisfied
their appetites and listened to the grateful words
of the farmer, who thanked them for their prompt
response to his wife’s appeals for assistance, they
put on their overcoats, which one of the boys had
brought in from the road during their absence,
and set out for the station with their prisoner.
The latter’s face began to show the effect of Don’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
blow, but the tramp did not seem to mind it. He
ate the cold bread and meat which the farmer’s
wife gave him just as he was about to leave the
house with his captors, and even joined in their
conversation.</p>

<p>When the students reached the depot they
were met by the agent, who laughed all over when
he saw the tramp, and drew Captain Mack off on
one side.</p>

<p>“You got him, didn’t you?” said he. “Some
of you must have given him a good pounding,
judging by his countenance. Now, if you are at
all sharp, you can capture the other.”</p>

<p>“Who? Huggins?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He went out to the mill and got a job
there at hauling wood. He was in here not ten
minutes ago, and I had a long talk with him. He
saw some of you looking out of the window when
the accommodation came in, and that was the reason
he took himself off in such a hurry. I told
him that you had gone on toward Oxford. He’ll
be back here with another load in less than an
hour, and then you can catch him.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you,” said Captain
Mack. “Now will you see if you can ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
where the professor and the rest of the boys
are?”</p>

<p>The agent said he would; but his efforts to find
them met with no success. The operators of
whom he made inquiries had all seen them, but
couldn’t tell where they were.</p>

<p>“They haven’t left the train yet,” said he.
“The accommodation will be at Munson in a
quarter of an hour, and then I will try again.”</p>

<p>Of course the captain could not make his report
until he knew where the professor was, so he and
his men went into the waiting-room, accompanied
by the tramp, and sat down there—all except Don
Gordon, who was ordered to hold himself in readiness
to capture the deserter when he came back
with the next load of wood.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">ABOUT VARIOUS THINGS.</span></h2>

<p>Don’s first care was to ascertain which way
Huggins would come from when he returned
from the mill with his wood, and his second to keep
behind the depot out of sight. He paced up and
down the platform in front of the door of the
waiting-room, so that he could be at hand to lend
assistance in case the tramp showed a disposition
to make trouble for Mack and Egan, but that
worthy had no more fight in him. He was a
coward and afraid of Don, and he wisely concluded
that the best thing he could do was to keep quiet.</p>

<p>At the end of twenty minutes the station-agent
came in. He had heard from the professor and
the rest of the squad, who had left the train at
Munson. At Captain Mack’s request he sent off
the following despatch:</p>

<p>“Have captured the tramp who robbed Huggins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and expect to have Huggins himself inside
of an hour.”</p>

<p>In due time the answer came back:</p>

<p>“Remain at the station until I come.”</p>

<p>“And when he comes, which will be about four
o’clock this afternoon, we shall have to go back to
our books and duties,” said the young officer,
stretching his arms and yawning. “I haven’t seen
a bit of fun during this scout, have you, Egan?
I hope the next fellow who makes up his mind to
desert the academy, will lead us a good long chase
and give us some work to do.”</p>

<p>The captain had his wish. The next time he
was sent in pursuit of a runaway, he did not come
back in one day nor two; and even at the end of
a week he had not completed his work. We shall
tell all about it presently.</p>

<p>The minutes wore away, and presently Don Gordon,
who stood where he could command a view
of the road for a long distance, saw a load of
wood coming out of the timber. There was somebody
walking beside it and driving the horses, but
Don would not have known it was Huggins had
not the station-agent, who was also on the watch,
at that moment opened his door and called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“There he is.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” replied Don, who straightway
pulled off his overcoat and dropped it upon the
platform. He knew nothing whatever of Huggins.
The latter might be a good runner or a good
fighter, and if he concluded to make a race of it
or to resist arrest, Don intended to be ready for
him.</p>

<p>Huggins approached the depot with fear and
trembling. He stopped very frequently to reconnoiter
the building and its surroundings, and
when he drew up to the wood-pile, he threw the
blankets over his steaming horses, and jumped
upon the platform. He wanted to make sure that
the coast was clear before he began throwing off
his load. Don could not see him now, but the
sound of his footsteps told him that the deserter
was approaching his place of concealment. When
he came around the corner of the building, Don
stepped into view and greeted him with the greatest
cordiality.</p>

<p>“Your name is Huggins, I believe,” said he;
and without giving the runaway time to recover
from his surprise and bewilderment, Don took him
by the arm and led him toward the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
waiting-room. “I am glad to see you,” he continued,
“and you will be glad to know that the
tramp who robbed you last night has surrendered
Lester Brigham’s money, and that your
clothes—— Hallo! What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Huggins had been brought to his senses by
Don’s words. He saw that he had run right into
a trap that had been prepared for him, and he
made a desperate attempt to escape. Throwing all
his strength, which was by no means insignificant,
into the effort, he tried to wrench his arm loose
from Don’s grasp, and to trip him up at the same
time; but the vicious kick he aimed at Don’s leg
expended its force in the empty air, and Huggins
turned part way around and sat down on the platform
very suddenly.</p>

<p>“What are you doing down there?” said Don,
taking the runaway by the collar and lifting him
to his feet. “Come into the waiting-room if you
want to sit down. I was about to say, when you
interrupted me, that you can get your clothes
back now. Mack’s got the money, and all your
property. Here we are. Walk right in and make
yourself at home.”</p>

<p>Captain Mack and Egan, who had kept a watchful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
eye on Don and his captive, but who dared not
go out to assist him for fear that the tramp would
improve the opportunity to escape, opened the
door of the waiting-room, and Huggins walked in
without saying a word. In obedience to Captain
Mack’s command an exchange of hats and coats
was made between the new prisoner and the man
who had robbed him, and after that another despatch
was sent to Professor Odenheimer. The
answer that came back was the same as the first.</p>

<p>The fun, as well as the work, was all over now,
and the students had nothing to do but walk
about the room and wait as patiently as they
could for the train that was to take them back to
Bridgeport. It came at last, and in due time the
tramp was handed over to the authorities to be
tried for highway robbery, while Huggins was
marched to his room to be kept there under guard
until his father came to take him away. He was
expelled from the school in general orders. Lester
Brigham was punished for keeping so large an
amount of money by him in violation of the regulations,
and Don Gordon was looked upon as a
hero. This hurt Lester more than anything else.
He had come there with the fixed determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to supplant Don and Bert in the estimation of
both teachers and students—to build himself up
by pulling them down—and he was not a little
disappointed as well as enraged, when he discovered
that it was not in his power to work them
any injury. He wrote a doleful letter to his father,
complaining of the indignities that were constantly
heaped upon him, and begging to be
allowed to go home; but for once in his life Mr.
Brigham was firm, and Lester was given to understand
that he must make up his mind to stay at
Bridgeport until the four years’ course was completed.</p>

<p>“I’ll show him whether I will or not,” said
Lester, who was almost beside himself with fury.
“He’ll <i>have</i> to let me go home. If Jones and the
rest will stand by me, I will kick up a row here
that will be talked of as long as the academy
stands. I’ll show the fellows that Don Gordon
isn’t the only boy in the world who has any pluck.”</p>

<p>In process of time Mr. Huggins came to the
academy to look into the charges that had been
made against his son, and when he went away, the
deserter went with him. It was a long time before
the boys knew what had become of him, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
left not a single friend at the academy, and there
was no one who corresponded with him.</p>

<p>Things went smoothly after that. Of course
there was some grand running, and a good deal of
extra sentry and police duty to be performed by
the idle and disobedient ones; but there were no
flagrant violations of the rules—no more thefts or
desertions. The malcontents were plucky enough
to do almost anything, but they lacked a leader.
There were no Don Gordons or Tom Fishers or
Clarence Duncans among them. They had expected
great things of Lester Brigham, but when
they became better acquainted with him, they
found that he was a boy of no spirit whatever. He
talked loudly and spent his money freely, and his
liberality brought him plenty of followers who were
quick to discover all the weak points in his character.
His insufferable vanity and self-conceit, his
hatred of Don Gordon, his fondness for telling of
the imaginary exploits he had performed both
afloat and ashore—all these were seized upon by a
certain class of boys who flattered him to his face,
ate unlimited quantities of pancakes and pies at
his expense and laughed at him behind his back.
But the idea he had suggested to them—that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
stealing a yacht and going off somewhere and
having a picnic—was not forgotten. They talked
about it at every opportunity; numerous plans for
their amusement were proposed and discussed,
and they had even selected the yacht in which
they intended to make their cruise. Lester was,
of course, the nominal leader, but Jones and
Enoch Williams did all the work and laid all the
plans.</p>

<p>The winter months passed quietly away, spring
with its trout-fishing and pickerel-spearing came
and went, and summer was upon them almost before
they knew it. Now the students went to work
in earnest, for the season of the annual camp and
the examination that followed it, was close at
hand. Even the lazy boys began to show some
signs of life now, for they had heard much of the
pleasures that were to be enjoyed during their
month under canvas, and they were as anxious as
the others to make a good showing in the presence
of the strangers and friends who would be sure to
visit them.</p>

<p>Lester Brigham would have looked forward to
the camping frolic with the greatest eagerness and
impatience if he had only had a corporal’s <i>chevrons</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to wear; but he hadn’t, and if we might judge by
his standing in his class, he was not likely to wear
them, either.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to stand guard and be bossed around
by that little whiffet of a Bert Gordon, who will
throw on more airs than he deserves,” Lester often
said to himself. “But I’ll not go to camp, if I
can help it. If I do, I’ll not stay there long, for I
will do something that will send me back to the
academy under arrest.”</p>

<p>This was a part of Jones’s programme. The
boys who were to steal the yacht and go to sea
in her—there were twenty-eight of them in all—were
to fall so far behind their classes that they
would be ordered to remain at the academy to
make up for lost time. If they did not succeed
in accomplishing their object and were sent to
camp against their will, they were to commit some
offence that would cause them to be marched back
under arrest. The boys growled lustily when this
programme was marked out for them, and some of
them flatly refused to follow it.</p>

<p>“As this is my first year at the academy I have
never been in camp, and I should like to see what
they do there,” said one. “Suppose those Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Pleasant Indians should come in again? I
shouldn’t like to miss that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any sense in waiting so long,” said
another. “Why can’t we go now?”</p>

<p>“Where’s the yacht?” asked Jones, in reply.
“There isn’t one in the harbor. They have all
gone off on a cruise. The first thing is to make
sure that we can get a boat. As soon as that
matter is settled, I will tell you what to do next.
If you will hold yourselves in readiness to move
when I say the word, I will guarantee that we
will see more fun than those who stay in camp.”</p>

<p>“What will they do with us after they capture
us?”</p>

<p>“They will court-martial and expel the last one
of us. That’s a foregone conclusion. If there are
any among us who desire to stay in this school,
they had better back down at once, so that we
may know who they are. But we’ll lead them a
lively race before we are caught; you may depend
upon that.”</p>

<p>Whenever Jones talked in this way there were
a few of his adherents—and they were the ones
who had exhibited the most enthusiasm when
Lester’s plan was first proposed—who felt their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
courage oozing out at the end of their fingers. It
was easy enough to talk about capturing and running
off with a private yacht, but as the time for
action drew nearer they began to show signs of
wavering. Unfortunately, however, an incident
happened during the latter part of June, which
did more to unite them, and to bring their runaway
scheme to a head, than almost anything else
could have done.</p>

<p>Among those who kept a watchful eye over the
interests of the academy, and who took the greatest
pride in its success, were the rank and file of
the 61st regiment of infantry, National Guards,
which was located at Hamilton, a thriving little
city about fifty miles north of Bridgeport. This
regiment was composed almost entirely of veterans,
and a few of them were the fathers, uncles
and older brothers of some of the boys who were
now wearing the academy uniform. Their colonel
and some of their field and line officers were graduated
there, and in the ranks were many bearded
fellows who, in the days gone by, had run the
guards to eat pancakes at Cony Ryan’s, and who
had paid for their fun by spending the next Saturday
afternoon in walking extras with muskets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
on their shoulders and packed knapsacks on their
backs.</p>

<p>The regiment had once spent a week in camp
with the academy boys, and this year was the
twenty-fifth anniversary of its organization. The
members intended to celebrate it by giving the
citizens of Hamilton the finest parade they had
witnessed for many a day. Regiments from Rhode
Island, New York and Ohio had given favorable
replies to the invitations that had been sent to
them, others from Virginia and North Carolina,
which had seen service under General Lee at Richmond,
had promised to be present, the firemen and
civic societies were to join in the parade, and the
academy boys were expected to be there in full
force. The line was to be formed after dinner
had been served in a big tent, and the festivities
were to conclude with a grand ball in the
evening.</p>

<p>When the superintendent read the invitation
before the school and asked the students what
they thought about it, they arose as one boy and
raised such a tumult of “Union cheers” and
“rebel yells” (remember there were a good many
Southern boys among them), that the superintendent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
after trying in vain to make his signal bell
heard, raised his hand to enforce silence.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, you know that such a demonstration
as this is a direct violation of our rules
and regulations,” said he, when the boys had resumed
their seats; but still he did not seem to be
very much annoyed. He judged that they were
unanimously in favor of accepting the invitation,
and the adjutant would be instructed to reply accordingly.
He hoped that every member of the
academy would be able to join in the parade, <i>but</i>
there were two things that must be distinctly understood:
The first was, that they could not remain
to take part in the festivities of the evening—they
must start for home at six o’clock. The boys,
he said, had all they could do to prepare themselves
for the examination, and pleasure must not be allowed
to interfere with business. If they deserved
it they would have plenty of recreation when they
went into camp. Just then a boy in the back
part of the room raised his hand. The superintendent
nodded to him, and the boy arose and said:</p>

<p>“Could we not march to and from the city,
camping out on the way, instead of going by
rail?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The flutter of excitement which this proposition
caused in every part of the school-room indicated
that the students were all in favor of it; but it
seems that the superintendent wasn’t. There
would be no objection, he said, if the parade were
to come off immediately; but the 24th of July
was the day that had been set for the celebration;
it would take three days to march there, as many
more to return, and seven days of study taken
from the end of the term would certainly show in
the examination. They were too valuable to be
wasted. One day was all he could allow them.</p>

<p>The second thing he wished them to understand
was this: The parade would be an event of some
consequence. It would afford them as much
pleasure as the fight with the Mount Pleasant Indians.
They would be surrounded by well-drilled
men who would watch all their movements with
critical eyes, and note and comment upon their
slightest errors or indiscretions. He had no fears
for the majority of the students, for he knew beforehand
that they would act like soldiers while
they were in the ranks, and like young gentlemen
when they were out of them; but there were some
among them, he was sorry to say, whose presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
would reflect no honor upon their companies—boys
who could not keep their eyes directed to the
front while they were marching, or hold their
heads still on dress-parade, and whose conduct,
when they were on the streets and out of sight of
their teachers and officers, would not be calculated
to win the respect of the citizens of Hamilton.
He did not want those boys to accompany them,
but still he would give them the same chance he
gave the others.</p>

<p>They had nearly five weeks of hard study and
drill before them, during which time it was possible
for any studious and attentive boy to run his
standing up to a hundred. Those who did that,
might be sure of a holiday and a general good
time on the 24th of July; but those who allowed
themselves to fall below seventy-five, would be
required to remain at the academy. He left the
matter in their own hands.</p>

<p>“I say, Don,” whispered Egan, as the students
marched out of the school-room, “if this thing
had happened last year, you and I would have
gone to the hop, wouldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“I believe we would,” answered Don.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say to——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll not do it,” was the emphatic response.
“If any of the other fellows have a mind to desert
and stay to the roll, they may do it and take
the consequences; but I won’t. I haven’t received
a single reprimand this term, not even from that
old martinet Odenheimer, and what’s more, I
don’t intend to put myself in the way of getting
one.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Gordon,” said Egan, approvingly.
“Stick to it, and the day that sees you a
first-class cadet, will see you lieutenant-colonel of
the academy battalion. You hear me?”</p>

<p>“I hope it will,” replied Don. “It certainly
will not see me a private; you may depend upon
that.”</p>

<p>That night Lester Brigham and his friend Jones
met in the gymnasium. Their followers came up,
one after the other, and in a few minutes there
was quite a crowd of boys gathered about them.
Some of them spoke with great enthusiasm
regarding the proposed excursion to Hamilton,
while others were sullen, and had but little to say.
Among the latter was Lester Brigham, who, having
wasted his time and fallen behind his class in
everything, saw very plainly that his chances for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
participating in the celebration were slim indeed.
He grew angry whenever he thought that he would
have to remain a prisoner at the academy while
the other boys in his company were seeing no end
of fun, and when he got that way, he was ready
for almost anything. He saw how his enforced
sojourn at Bridgeport could be turned to account;
but the next thing was to make the rest of the
fellows see it.</p>

<p>“Things couldn’t have been planned to suit us
better, could they?” said Lester, as the boys
crowded about him.</p>

<p>“They might have been planned to suit <i>me</i>
better—a good deal better,” growled one, in reply.
“I wish that invitation had been sent a month
ago. Then I should have gone to work in earnest,
and perhaps I would stand some chance of going
to Hamilton with my company.”</p>

<p>“Why, do you want to go?” exclaimed Lester.</p>

<p>“Of course I do, and I will, too, if there is anything
to be gained by faithful effort. If you catch
me in any mischief before the result of the next
five weeks’ study is announced, you may shoot
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“And me; and me,” chorused several of the
boys.</p>

<p>“Look here, Brigham,” said Jones. “That
celebration will be the grandest thing you ever
saw, outside of a big city, and we mustn’t miss
it.”</p>

<p>“I was going to suggest that it would be a
good time to start off on our cruise,” said Lester.
“The boys who will be left here to stand guard
will be fellows after our own hearts, and we can
easily induce them to pass us or to join in with
us.”</p>

<p>“That’s my idea,” said another.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t mine,” said Jones, in very decided
tones.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know what the understanding
was?” began Lester.</p>

<p>“I know all about it,” replied Jones. “I ought
to, for I proposed it. The bargain was, that we
were to be left out of camp, if we could, so that
we could desert the academy when it was not
strongly guarded. Failing that, we were to leave
the camp in a body, capture our boat and go to
sea in her. Wasn’t that the agreement, boys?”</p>

<p>The students all said it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am ready to live up to that agreement,” continued
Jones; “but I wouldn’t miss that parade
for any money. I am going to the ball in the
evening, too.”</p>

<p>“You can’t,” said Lester. “The superintendent
said you would come home on the six o’clock
train.”</p>

<p>“Some will and some won’t,” said a boy who
had not spoken before. “It will be an easy matter
for those of us who want to stay, to slip away and
hide until the rest of the boys are gone. If I go
to Hamilton I shall go to the dance.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll stay here,” said Lester, who was disappointed
as well as enraged. “But when you
return, you will not find me. I am going off on a
cruise if I have to steal a skiff and go alone.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t go alone,” said one of the boys.
“I will go with you.”</p>

<p>“Wait until August and we will all go with
you,” said Jones.</p>

<p>“I can’t and I shan’t. I have waited long
enough already. I have seen quite enough of this
school.”</p>

<p>These were the sentiments of a good many of
the students, who gradually drew over to Lester’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
side, and when the latter had run his eye over
them, he found that there were an even dozen who
were willing to stand by him.</p>

<p>“Whose side are you on, Enoch?” inquired
Lester.</p>

<p>He waited with considerable anxiety for the reply,
for he knew that a good deal depended upon
Enoch Williams. He was to be first officer of the
yacht, when they got her (the real commander, in
fact, for Lester, who was to be the captain, didn’t
know the starboard rail from the main truck) and
if Lester could induce him to come over to his side,
the rest of the boys would probably come with
him.</p>

<p>“I go with the majority,” answered Enoch.
“The most of the fellows have declared against
your plan, and if they are going to the celebration,
I am going too.”</p>

<p>“By dividing in this way, you act as if you desire
to read us out of your good books,” said
Jones. “If that is the case, all right. If you
will keep still about us and our plans, we will not
blow on you. If you succeed in reaching the bay,
and in eluding the tugs that are sent after you,
we may join you some time during the second week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in August, if you will tell us where you are
going.”</p>

<p>“They are a pack of cowards,” observed Lester,
as Jones and Williams walked away, followed by
their friends. “You fellows did well to side with
me. They had no intention of helping us capture
that yacht, and this is the way they take to get
out of it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether we have done well or
not,” said one of Lester’s friends, when he saw the
others moving away. “Now that Enoch has deserted
us, who is there to command the boat?”</p>

<p>“Why, I am to have charge of her,” said Lester,
with a look of surprise. “That was understood
from the very first.”</p>

<p>“But you are a fresh-water sailor and don’t
know anything about the coast,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“I know I don’t, and neither does Enoch. But
I never yet got a vessel into a place that I couldn’t
get her out of, and if you will trust to me I will
look out for your safety and insure you lots of fun
besides,” said Lester, confidently; and then he
wondered what he should do if the boys took him
at his word.</p>

<p>“I must see if I can’t induce Enoch to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
by me,” said he to himself. “If he refuses, the
whole thing is up stump, for I can’t command the
yacht, and I am not foolish enough to try it. I
will wait a few days, and perhaps something will
turn up in my favor.”</p>

<p>Lester was not disappointed. When each
scholar’s standing for the week was announced
on Friday night, Jones had only fifty marks to
his credit, while Enoch Williams was obliged to
be satisfied with thirty.</p>

<p>“I’ve done my level best,” said the former, in a
discouraged tone, “and now I believe I’ll give it
up.”</p>

<p>“Never say die,” said Enoch, hopefully. “I
have better reason for being discouraged than you
have. I shall try harder than ever from this time
on, and if I can get up as high as ninety next
week, and stay there, that will make my average
standing seventy-eight. You <i>must</i> try, old boy,
for I don’t want to go to Hamilton unless you do.
Give me your promise.”</p>

<p>Jones gave it, but said he didn’t think anything
would come of it.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A TEST OF COURAGE.</span></h2>

<p>It was by no means a common occurrence for
the best of the scholars to win a hundred credit
marks in a week, for in order to do it, it was
necessary that they should be perfect in everything.
If their standing and deportment as students
were all they desired them to be, they ran
the risk of falling behind in their record as soldiers.
If they handled their muskets a little too
quickly or too slowly while their company was going
through the manual of arms, if they forgot
that the guide was left when marching in platoon
front, and allowed themselves to fall half an inch
out of line, or if they turned their heads on dress-parade
to watch the band while it “rounded off,”
they were sure to be reported and to lose some of
their hard-earned credit marks.</p>

<p>Don Gordon worked early and late, and his
average for the first three weeks was ninety—Bert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
following close behind with eighty-eight. Jones
and Enoch Williams did not do as well, and Lester
was out of the race almost before it was begun.
Enoch made a gallant struggle, and would have
succeeded in winning the required number of
marks if Jones had only let him alone; but at the
end of the third week the latter gave up trying.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Williams,” said he. “I’ve made
a bad showing, thanks to the partiality of the instructors,
who don’t intend to let a fellow win on
his merits. I have made just a hundred and forty
altogether, and if I could make a clean score during
the next two weeks, my average would be
sixty-eight—seven points too low. Now what are
you going to do?”</p>

<p>“You can’t possibly make seventy-five, can
you?” said Enoch, after he had performed a little
problem in mental arithmetic. “Well, if you’ve
got to stay behind, I’ll stay too. How about that
picnic? Lester hasn’t been near me in a long
time. He and his crowd seem to hang together
pretty well, and I shouldn’t wonder if they had
got their plans all laid.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hunt him up and have a talk with him,”
said Jones. “We have made him mad, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
we shall have hard work to get him good-natured
again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he never gets good-natured
again,” answered Enoch. “I have long been of
the opinion that we ought to throw that fellow
overboard. We shall certainly see trouble through
him if we do not.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see trouble if we do,” said Jones, earnestly.
“I have studied him pretty closely, and I
have found out that there is no honor in him.
We’ve gone too far to drop him now. If we
should attempt it, he’d blow on us as sure as the
world.”</p>

<p>Jones struck pretty close to the mark when he
said this, for Lester had already set his wits to
work to conjure up some plan to keep the boys
who would not side with him at the academy
while he and the rest were off on their cruise. He
had decided that when the proper time came he
would make an effort to induce Enoch to go with
him, and if he refused, he (Lester) would take
care to see that he didn’t go at all. He would
contrive some way to let the superintendent know
what he and Jones and their crowd intended
to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Brigham is no sailor, and there’s where the
trouble is coming in,” said Enoch.</p>

<p>“I confess that I have often had my fears on
that point,” replied Jones; “but we mustn’t
think of leaving him behind. Let him act as
leader, if he can, until we are fairly afloat, and
then, if we find he doesn’t know what he is about,
we can easily depose him and put you in his
place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to be captain,” said Enoch. “I’d
just as soon go before the mast, provided there is
somebody on the quarter-deck who understands
his business. These racing boats are cranky
things, and sometimes they turn bottom side up
without any provocation at all. There’s Brigham
now.”</p>

<p>Lester was delighted to learn that his two old
cronies were ready to side with him, but he did
not show it. He appeared to be quite indifferent.</p>

<p>“I listened with all my ears when the last
week’s standing was announced, and I know very
well what it was that brought you over to me,”
said he, addressing himself to Jones. “You’re
going to fall below seventy-five in spite of all you
can do, and Enoch doesn’t want to go to Hamilton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
without you. I’ll have to talk to the boys
about it. Perhaps they will say they don’t want
you, because you went back on us once.”</p>

<p>“I say we didn’t go back on you or anybody
else,” said Enoch, looking savagely at Lester.
“We are ready to stand by our agreement, and
you are not.”</p>

<p>Jones and Williams, believing that Lester was
not very favorably disposed toward them, thought
it would be a good plan to talk to the boys about
it themselves. They found that some were glad
to welcome them back, but that those who wanted
to go to Hamilton and who were working hard,
and with a fair prospect of success, to win the
required number of marks, met their advances
rather coldly.</p>

<p>“Let the celebration go and come with us,”
urged Jones. “I’ll warrant you’ll see more fun on
the bay than you will in marching about the dusty
streets of Hamilton while the mercury is away up
in the nineties.”</p>

<p>“Sour grapes!” exclaimed one of the boys.
“Look here, Jones. A little while ago this parade
was the grandest thing that ever was thought
of, and you wouldn’t miss it for any amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
money. You tried your best to win a place in the
ranks of your company, but you failed, and now
you want us to fail, too. I can’t see the beauty
of that.”</p>

<p>There was more than one who couldn’t see it—boys
who spent all their time with their books and
watched themselves closely, in the hope of attaining
to the required standing. Some succeeded and
others did not. Those who failed fell back into
the ranks of Lester’s crowd, angry and discouraged,
and ready for anything that would close the doors
of that school against them forever. The fortunate
ones, turning a deaf ear to the pleadings of their
companions, but promising to keep a still tongue
in their heads regarding the proposed picnic, went
to the city with their company, and we must hasten
on to tell what happened to them while on the
way, and what they did after they got there.</p>

<p>While these things were going on inside of the
academy, some stirring events, in which a few of
the students finally became personally interested,
were occurring outside of it. The daily papers, to
which many of the boys were subscribers, began
to speak of railroad strikes, and in every issue
there was a column or more of telegrams relating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to “labor troubles.” The boys read them, simply
because they wanted to keep themselves posted, as
far as they could, in all that was going on in the
world; but they paid no particular attention to
them. The news came from distant points and
did not affect them in any way, because they were
independent of the railroads and would be until
September. If the hands on the Bordentown
branch, the road that ran from Oxford through
Bridgeport to Hamilton, wanted to strike for
higher wages, they could do it and welcome.
There was no law to prevent them. In fact, the
students hoped they would do it, for then they
could shoulder their muskets and march to the
city, as the majority of them wanted to do.</p>

<p>Time passed and things began to assume a more
serious aspect. The strike became general and
trouble was feared. The strikers would not work
themselves nor would they allow others to work;
and when men came to take their places they won
them over to their side, or assaulted them with
clubs and stones and drove them away. The lawless
element of the country, the “dangerous
classes,”—the thieves, loafers, tramps and socialists,
who had everything to make and nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
lose, joined with the strikers; and although the
latter repudiated and denounced them in strong
language, they did not send them away. The police
could do nothing, and finally the National
Guard was called out; but its presence did not
seem to have any effect. The most of the guard
were working men, and the strikers did not believe
they would use their weapons even if ordered to
do so. At Buffalo the mob threw aside the bayonets
that were crossed in front of the door of a machine
shop, and went in and compelled the men
to stop work. Not satisfied with that they attacked
the company that was guarding the shop
and put it to flight. A Chicago paper announced,
with much trepidation, that there were twenty
thousand well-armed socialists in that city, who
were threatening to do all sorts of terrible things;
a Baltimore mob stoned and scattered the soldiers
who had been sent there to preserve order; New
York was like a seething cauldron, almost ready
to boil over; the strikers and their allies had got
beyond control at Pittsburg, and were destroying
the property of the railroad companies; and thus
were ushered in “those dark days in July, 1877,
when the whole land was threatened with anarchy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell you, boys, this is becoming interesting,”
said Egan, as he and his particular friends met
one morning on the parade ground, each with a
paper in his hand. “Just listen to this despatch
from Pittsburg: ‘A large force of strikers has
captured a train, and is running about the country,
picking up arms and ammunition wherever
they can be found. A regiment is expected from
Philadelphia this evening.’”</p>

<p>(This regiment didn’t do any good after it
arrived. It was whipped at once, driven out of
the city, and every effort was made by the strikers
and their friends to have its commanding officer
indicted for murder, because he defended himself
when he was attacked.)</p>

<p>“That’s the worst news I have heard yet,” said
Curtis, anxiously. “We’ve got about four hundred
stand of arms and two thousand ball cartridges
in the armory.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed the boys, in concert.</p>

<p>“And if the men who are employed on this railroad
should take it into their heads to come here
and get them—eh?” continued Curtis. “It would
be worse than the fight with the Mount Pleasant
Indians, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say so,” cried Hopkins, growing
alarmed. “But these Bordentown fellows are all
right yet.”</p>

<p>“They’ve struck,” said Don. “My paper says
that Hamilton is in an uproar, that business is virtually
suspended, that the mob is growing bolder
every hour, and that the 61st has been ordered to
hold itself in readiness to march at a moment’s
notice.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” said Hopkins. “The strikers
have stopped all the freights, but they haven’t yet
interfered with the mail trains, nor have they attempted
any violence.”</p>

<p>“If they would only stick to that, they would
have a good deal of sympathy,” said Curtis. “But
when they defy the law and trample upon the
rights of other people, they ought to be put down
with an iron hand, and I hope they will be.”</p>

<p>“You may have a chance to assist at it,” said
Egan.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if he did,” exclaimed Don,
when the other boys smiled incredulously. “Mark
my words: There’s going to be trouble in Hamilton.
There are a good many car-shops and founderies
there, and one regiment, which numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
only four hundred and fifty men, can’t be everywhere.</p>

<p>“And of those four hundred and fifty men how
many do you suppose there are who do not sympathize
with the strikers?” asked Egan.</p>

<p>“There are at least two companies—the Hamilton
Tigers and the Sanford Guards,” replied Hopkins.
“You can depend on them every time.”</p>

<p>“And if the others show a disposition to get
up on their ears, there will be visiting troops
enough to handle them without gloves,” observed
Curtis.</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” answered Don. “Rumor
says that the most, if not all, the regiments that
were expected to be there, have been ordered, by
the adjutant-generals of their respective States, to
stay at home.”</p>

<p>“And some of the firemen have given notice
that they will not turn out,” added Hopkins.</p>

<p>“That knocks the parade higher than a kite,”
exclaimed Egan. “Well, there’s no loss without
some gain. The prospect of marching with the
61st, had a good effect on me. It made me study
hard and behave myself. Hallo! what’s the
matter with you? Any startling news?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>This question was addressed to Sergeants Gordon
and Elmer, who just then hurried up, bringing
with them pale and anxious faces.</p>

<p>“Oh, fellows!” stammered Bert. “We’re going
to have trouble right here at the academy.”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed all the boys at once.</p>

<p>“But I say we are,” said Bert; who then went
on to tell what had happened to Elmer and himself
just a few minutes before. They had been
sent to the village on business, and in going and
coming they were obliged to pass the railroad depot.
They noticed that there were a good many
men gathered on the platform and standing
around in little groups, all talking in low and earnest
tones, but no one paid any attention to them
until they came back, and then one of the truck
hands, who was dressed in his Sunday clothes,
stepped out and confronted them.</p>

<p>“Arrah, me foine gentlemen,” said he, nodding
with his head and winking his eyes vigorously,
“it’s a swate little rod we have in pickle fur yees,
intirely; do yees moind that?”</p>

<p>The boys made no reply. They turned out and
tried to go by the man, but he spread out his arms
and stopped them both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll have thim foine soldier clothes aff the
back of yees the day,” said he, with a leer.</p>

<p>“Be good enough to let us pass,” said Bert.
“We have no desire to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t yees now? Well, <i>I’ll</i> spake to <i>yees</i>.
Yer foine lookin’ little b’ys to be takin’ the brid
from the mouth of the wurrukin’ mon an’ his childer,
so ye are. I’ve a moind to knock the hids aff
yees.”</p>

<p>“Move on there, Mickey,” commanded a policeman.</p>

<p>“Shure I will; but moind this, the hul of yees:
We have min enough, an’ there’s more comin’ from
Hamilton, to take all the arrums yees have up
there to the school-house beyant, and there’ll not
be a soldier nor a polace lift the night. We’ll
trample them into the ground like the dirt under
our feet; an’ so we will do with all the big min
who want to grind down the wurrukin’ mon; ain’t
that so, me brave b’ys?”</p>

<p>The “brave boys” who were standing around
did not confirm these words, and neither did they
deny them. They looked sullen and savage, and
the two sergeants were glad to hurry on and leave
them out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“He said they were going to clean us out to-night,
did he,” exclaimed Don, when Bert had
finished his story. “Well, they will have a
good time of it. Some of the boys are pretty
fair shots.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope it won’t come to that,” said Sergeant
Elmer.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Don. “But there’s only one
way to reason with a mob, and that is to thrash
them soundly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why that man should pitch into
us,” observed Bert. “If he would go to work, he
would get bread enough for himself and his children.
If the working man is ‘ground down’ we
had no hand in it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Egan. “But you wear
a uniform and are supposed to be strongly in favor
of law and order.”</p>

<p>“And we are, too,” said Bert, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Well, that man knew it, and that was the
reason he talked to you in the way he did,” continued
Egan. “He and his kind hate a soldier as
cordially as they hate the police, because the soldier
is always ready to step in and help the policeman
when the mob gets too strong for him; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
when the boys in blue take a hand in the muss,
the rioters generally hear something drop. Now,
Bert, you and Elmer had better go and report to
the superintendent.”</p>

<p>All that day the excitement at the academy was
intense, and it was no wonder that the lessons
were bad, that such faithful fellows as Mack, Egan,
Curtis and Bert Gordon came in for the sternest
reprimands, or that the teachers looked worried
and anxious—all except Professor Odenheimer.
He was in his element, for he scented the battle
from afar. His lectures were full of fight, and
never had his classes listened to them with so
much interest. When night came the excitement
increased. It was plain that the superintendent
had received information which led him to believe
that it was best to be prepared for any emergency,
for the guards were doubled, mattresses were
issued to the members of the first company who
bunked in the armory, and the boys who went on
post were supplied with ball cartridges.</p>

<p>Another thing that increased the excitement
and added to the general disquiet and alarm, was
the rumor that all idea of a parade had been abandoned,
and that the brigade commander had asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the superintendent what he could do for him, if
help were needed at Hamilton. There was a mob
there, and it was having things all its own way.
It was growing stronger and bolder all the while,
the police were afraid of it, the majority of the soldiers
sympathized with it, and the only company
that had done anything was the Hamilton Tigers,
which had cleared the depot at the point of the
bayonet.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say there would be trouble in the city
before this thing was settled?” asked Don Gordon
of some of his friends whom he met in the
armory when dress parade was over.</p>

<p>“And didn’t I say that the Tigers would do
their duty every time?” answered Hopkins. “But
do you suppose the superintendent will order any
of us down there?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he?” inquired Curtis in his
quiet way.</p>

<p>“Because we don’t belong to the National
Guard, and there is no precedent for any such
proceeding,” answered Hopkins.</p>

<p>“There’s where you are mistaken,” said Egan.
“The students at the Champaign Agricultural College
in Illinois didn’t belong to the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Guard, but when Chicago was burned some of
them were ordered up there to protect property,
and I never heard it said that they didn’t do their
duty as well as men could have done it. It will
be no boy’s play, but I shall hold myself in readiness
to volunteer with the company that is ordered
down there.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t,” said a voice.</p>

<p>The boys looked around and saw Williams,
Jones, Lester Brigham and several of that crowd
standing close by. The faces of the most of them
were very pale, and Lester was trembling visibly.
Under ordinary circumstances they would have
been ordered away at once; but class etiquette
was forgotten now. The young soldiers had something
else to think about.</p>

<p>“I didn’t come here to fight,” continued Enoch
Williams, “and I won’t do it, either.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to help yourself?” asked
Curtis. “Will you skip over to Canada? That’s
what some of the Hamilton boys have done.”</p>

<p>“No; but I’ll refuse to do duty, and stay here
under arrest,” replied Enoch.</p>

<p>“And be court-martialed for cowardice and disgracefully
dismissed the academy when the trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is over,” said Egan. “Don’t let the people
down in Maryland hear of it, Enoch. They’ll cut
you, sure.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if they do,” was the defiant
response. “I have no desire to be knocked in the
head with a coupling-pin.”</p>

<p>The other boys didn’t want to be treated that
way either, but they had no intention of shirking
their duty. They didn’t care to talk with Enoch
and his friends, and so they turned away and left
them alone.</p>

<p>There was little sleeping done in the academy
that night, and those who did slumber kept one
eye and both ears open, and were ready to jump at
the very first note of alarm. It came shortly after
midnight. All on a sudden the clear blast of a
bugle rang through the silent building, being followed
an instant later by the “long roll.” There
was a moment’s hush, and then hasty footsteps
sounded in the different halls, and heavy blows
were showered upon the dormitory doors, mingled
with loud cries of, “Fall in! Fall in!”</p>

<p>“The mob has come! Now we’ll know how it
seems to engage in a real battle,” were the words
with which each boy encouraged his room-mate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
as he sprang out of bed and pulled on his clothes.
“The rioters at Hamilton number ten thousand
men; and if they have all come up here, what can
three hundred boys do with them?”</p>

<p>There were some pale faces among the young
soldiers who jerked open their doors and ran at the
top of their speed towards the armory, but not
one of them was seen to falter. Some of them <i>did</i>
falter, however, but we shall see that they did not
escape detection.</p>

<p>In a great deal less than the six minutes that
were usually allotted for falling in in the morning,
the majority of the boys were in line and
ready for business. And that there was business
to be done they did not doubt, for no sooner
had the companies been formed than they were
marched down the stairs in double time and out
of the building, which in a few seconds more was
surrounded by a wall of bayonets; but they could
neither see nor hear anything of the mob.</p>

<p>“I say, Hop,” whispered Don to his fat friend
who stood next to him in the ranks, “this is
another put-up job. There are no cartridges in
my box.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Hopkins, after he had satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
himself that his own box was empty. “The
teachers only wanted to test our pluck.”</p>

<p>Just then the big bell in the cupola was struck
once—half-past twelve—and a few seconds later
the voice of a sentry rang out on the quiet air.</p>

<p>“No. 1. All’s well!” shouted the guard; and
this assurance removed a heavy burden of anxiety
from the mind of more than one boy in the ranks.</p>

<p>The whole thing was out now, and as there was
nothing to be gained by standing there in the
dark, the companies were marched back to the
armory and the roll was called. The ranks of the
first and second companies were full, Jones and a
few like him were missing from Don’s, and Bert
found, to his great mortification, that fully a dozen
of his men had failed to respond to their names.
The reports were made through the usual channels,
and when the result was announced to the
superintendent, he ordered details from the third
and fourth companies to hunt up the delinquents.
The rest of the battalion were brought to “parade
rest” and kept there, until the missing boys were
brought in. Some of them had been taken ill as
soon as they heard the order to fall in; others had
sought safety and concealment in the attic; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a few had been found in the cellar and pulled out
of the coal-bins. They looked very crestfallen and
ashamed when they found themselves drawn up in
line in full view of their companions, and expected
to receive the sternest kind of a reprimand; but
the superintendent did not once look toward
them.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen,” said he, addressing himself
to the boys who stood in the ranks, “I am
much pleased with the result of my experiment.
I did not expect so prompt a response from so
many of you. The honors belong to the third
company. It was the first to fall in, and Captain
Mack was the first to report himself and his men
ready for duty. I shall bear that company in
mind. You can now return to your respective
dormitories and go to sleep with the full assurance
that there is no mob here and none coming. All
is quiet in the city. The 61st is under arms, but
no trouble is apprehended. Break ranks!”</p>

<p>“Attention, company! Carry arms! Right
face! Arms port! Break ranks, march!”
shouted the several captains; and the boys scattered
and deposited their muskets in their proper
places, each one congratulating himself and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
neighbor on the indefinite postponement of the
fight with the mob, which the most of them believed
would be sure to take place sooner or later.
The members of Don’s company had reason to be
proud of themselves, but there were some among
them who shook their heads dubiously whenever
they recalled the superintendent’s words: “I
shall bear that company in mind.” What did he
mean by that?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIGHT AS REPORTED.</span></h2>

<p>“It means that if the authorities at Hamilton
need help in putting down that mob, we
third company boys will have to give it,” said
Egan, in reply to a question propounded to him
by Captain Mack.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by <i>we</i>?” inquired the
captain. “You don’t belong to my company.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, and so do Hop and Curtis,” answered
Egan. “We intend to report for duty in
the morning; and as long as this strike lasts, we
are to stand post and do duty like the rest of the
boys. We asked permission of the superintendent
to-day, and he granted it.”</p>

<p>Of course he granted it. Faithful students,
like these three boys, were allowed to do pretty
nearly as they pleased. It was the idle and unruly
who were denied privileges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad to welcome such fellows as you are
into my family,” said Captain Mack. “But why
didn’t you go into the first company where you
belong?”</p>

<p>“We belong wherever it suits us to go,” said
Egan, in reply. “And it suits us to be with you
and Don Gordon. Look here, Mack: If worst
comes to worst, and the superintendent calls for
volunteers, you be the first to jump. Do you
hear? Good night and pleasant dreams.”</p>

<p>The students hastened back to their rooms, and
feeling secure from an attack by the mob, the
most of them slept; but their dreams, like Captain
Mack’s, were none of the pleasantest. More
than one of them started up in alarm, believing
that he heard the order to fall in. They all expected
it, and it came the next day about eleven
o’clock, but the majority of the boys did not know
it until dinner time; and then Don Gordon, who
had been acting as the superintendent’s orderly
that morning, rushed frantically about the building
looking for Egan and the rest.</p>

<p>“The time has come, fellows,” said he, when he
found them. “Some of us will have to face the
music now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Egan and his
friends, in a breath.</p>

<p>“The superintendent received a despatch from
the city a short time ago.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what was in it?”</p>

<p>“I do, for I heard him read it to one of the
teachers. It ran: ‘Hold a company, provided
with ten rounds per man, ready to move at short
notice.’ The answer that went back was: ‘The
company is ready.’”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Curtis, while the others
looked at one another in blank amazement.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see how that company is to get to
Hamilton,” said Hopkins, at length. “There are
no trains running to-day. Everything is as quiet
as it is on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“They will go by special train,” said Don.
“There are a good many passengers and a big
mail that were left at Munson last night when the
engineer of the lightning express was taken by
force from his cab, and the mob has agreed to let
them come on to Hamilton. It was all talked
over in my hearing.”</p>

<p>“And our boys are to go on that train, are
they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; if they get marching orders in time.”</p>

<p>“Then there’ll be trouble. Remember what I
tell you; there will be the biggest kind of a fuss
down there,” said Curtis, earnestly. “The rioters
didn’t agree to let soldiers into the city, and they
won’t do it, either.”</p>

<p>“Did it ever occur to you, that very possibly
the wishes of the rabble will not be consulted?”
inquired Hopkins. “I hope that company will go
in if it is needed there, and that the very first
man who fires a stone into its ranks will get hurt.”</p>

<p>Just then the enlivening notes of the dinner-call
sounded through the building, and the students
made all haste to respond to it. The different
companies formed in their respective halls, but
when they had been aligned and brought to a right
face by their quartermaster-sergeants, the captains
took command, ordered the sergeants to their
posts, and marched their men to the armory instead
of to the dining-hall. They all wondered
what was going to happen now, and they were not
kept long in suspense.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen,” said the superintendent,
when all the companies had come into line, “our
friends in Hamilton are in need of assistance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
we, being law-loving and law-abiding men and
boys, and utterly opposed to mob rule, can not
refuse to give it to them. It may be—nay, I am
sure, from what I have heard, that it is a mission
of danger; and therefore I shall not ask any of you
to go to the city against your will. Those of you
who are in favor of the law, and who have the
courage to enforce it if you are called upon to do
so, will step three paces to the front.”</p>

<p>These words, which were spoken so rapidly that
those who heard them did not have time to think
twice, fairly stunned the boys. Egan, who stood
next the first sergeant of the third company, was
the first to recover himself. Reaching around behind
the sergeant he gave Captain Mack a prod
in the ribs with his fist that fairly knocked him
out of his place in the ranks; but it brought him
to his senses, and raising his hand to his cap the
captain said:</p>

<p>“I speak for my company, sir.”</p>

<p>“Your services are accepted,” said the superintendent.
“You are too late, young gentlemen,” he
added, addressing himself to the boys in the first
and second companies who moved forward in a
body, together with the majority of the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of Bert’s company. “You ought to have had an
old first-sergeant in your ranks to wake you up.”</p>

<p>This was Greek to some of the students, but
Mack understood it and so did Egan. So did the
boys directly behind them, who had seen Egan
strike the captain in the ribs to “wake him up.”</p>

<p>“If your conduct last night is any criterion, I
shall have reason to be proud of you when you
return,” continued the superintendent, turning
to the third company boys. “I shall expect
you to do your duty regardless of consequences;
and in order that you may work to the best advantage,
I shall make some changes in your <i>personnel</i>.”</p>

<p>Here the superintendent paused and looked at
the adjutant, who stepped forward and drew his
note-book from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Mack, you’re a brick,” said Egan, in an
audible whisper.</p>

<p>“He’s a born fool,” said Jones to the boy who
stood next him. “I didn’t give him authority to
speak for me, and I’ll not stir one step. If he
wants to go down there and be pounded to death
by that mob, he can go and welcome; but he shall
not drag me along with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is not expected that boys who take refuge
in the attic or hide in coal-bins, or who are seized
with the pangs of sickness at the very first notes
of a false alarm, would be of any use to you if
you should get into trouble,” added the superintendent.
“Consequently those boys will be permitted
to remain at the academy. As fast
as their names are called they will fall out of
the ranks and form a squad by themselves
under command of Sergeant Elmer, who will
have charge of them until their company returns.”</p>

<p>Some of those who had behaved with so much
timidity the night before, thought this the severest
punishment that could be inflicted upon them.
They were virtually branded as cowards in the
presence of the whole school, and they felt it most
keenly; but the others, those who had determined
to be sent down since their parents would not
allow them to leave the academy, as they wanted to
do, did not seem to mind it at all. They were
perfectly willing to be disgraced. They fell out of
the ranks as their names were called, and after their
places had been supplied by boys from the first
and second companies whom the superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
knew he could trust, they were all marched down
to the dining-hall.</p>

<p>There was little dinner eaten that day, for their
excitement took away all their appetites. The
hum of animated conversation arose above the
clatter of knives and forks from all except the
third company boys, who were already looked upon
as heroes by some of their companions. They were
going down to the city to face an infuriated mob,
and who can tell what the result might be? These
boys talked only in whispers, and the all-absorbing
question with them was: What teacher would
be sent in command of them? Everybody seemed
to think it would be Professor Odenheimer, who,
by his fiery lectures, had now the appellation of
“Fighting Jacob,” which the students transformed
into “Viting Yawcop.” Everybody seemed
to think, too, that if he were sent in command,
they would stand a fine chance of getting into a
fight, whether the mob forced it upon them or not.</p>

<p>The study-call was not sounded that afternoon,
because the teachers knew that there would be no
studying done. The students gathered in little
groups in the building and about the grounds, and
there was an abundance of talk, argument and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
speculation. They were all anxious for news, and
it did not take long to raise a crowd. If a teacher,
an officer or an orderly stopped for a moment to
exchange a word or two with one of the students,
they were very soon joined by a third, the number
was rapidly augmented, and a large assembly was
quickly gathered. The wildest rumors were freely
circulated as facts, and if the third company boys
had believed half they heard, it is hard to tell
whether or not their courage would have stood the
test. The excitement arose to fever-heat when a
messenger-boy, who had been passed by the sentry
at the gate, ran up the walk with a brown envelope
in his hand.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is it?” cried the students,
as he dashed through their ranks.</p>

<p>“It’s for the superintendent,” was the boy’s
reply.</p>

<p>“But what does it say?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know; only there’s the very mischief to
pay down at Hamilton. The special is due in fifteen
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re off, boys,” said Egan; and so it
proved. A few minutes after the messenger-boy
vanished through the door, a sergeant appeared on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the steps and cried out: “Fall in, third company!”
whereupon all the boys made a rush for
the armory. Don and his comrades made all haste
to put on their belts and epaulets and take
their muskets from the racks, while the rest of
the students drew themselves up in line behind
the teachers so that they could see all that was
going on.</p>

<p>“Fall in!” commanded the first sergeant.
“Left face! Support arms! Listen to roll-call!”</p>

<p>Each boy in the ranks brought his piece to a
“carry” and then to “order arms,” as his name
was called, and when this ceremony was completed
the company was again brought to a “carry,”
and ordered to “count fours”; after which the
sergeant proceeded to divide it into platoons.
Then he faced about, saluted his commander and
said, with a ring of triumph in his tones:</p>

<p>“All present, sir.”</p>

<p>There was no one hiding in the attic or coal-bins
this time.</p>

<p>“Fix bayonets,” said the captain.</p>

<p>The sergeant gave the order and moved to his
place on the right of the company, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
captain in command. His first move was to open
the ranks, and his next to order the quartermaster-sergeant
to supply each man with ten
rounds of ammunition. Candor compels us to say
that the sergeant did not strictly obey this order.
He was careful to put ten cartridges, and no more,
into each box, but he did not scruple to put three
or four extra ones into the hand that was holding
the box open.</p>

<p>By this time the boys had found out who was to
be their real commander. It was Mr. Kellogg, the
most popular instructor at the academy. He was
a modest, unassuming gentleman, but he was a
soldier all over. He had served in the army of the
Potomac, and had twice been carried to the rear
and laid among the dead. The boys knew he was
going with them, for he was dressed in fatigue
uniform and wore a sword by his side.</p>

<p>The cartridges having been distributed and the
company brought to close order, it was marched
out of the armory and down the stairs. When
the other students saw it preparing to move, they
rushed out in a body, ran to the gate, and drawing
themselves up in line on each side of the walk,
stood ready to give their friends a good “send off.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
When the company marched through their ranks,
led by the band which was to accompany it to the
depot, they broke out into deafening cheers, which
Captain Mack and his men answered with a will.
Don caught just one glimpse of his brother’s face
as he passed. It was whiter than his own.</p>

<p>The students followed the company as far as
the gate, and then ran along the fence to keep it
in view as long as they could; but all they could
see of it were the bayonets, the young soldiers
themselves being wholly concealed by the crowd of
citizens who had assembled to see them off. The
men cheered them lustily, the ladies waved their
handkerchiefs, and the girls threw flowers at them
until a bend in the road hid them from sight.
Then the boys who were left behind turned away
from the fence, and walked slowly toward the
academy.</p>

<p>“I’d much rather be here than with them,” said
Jones to his friend Lester, and the latter did not
doubt it, for Jones was one of the boys who had
been found in the cellar. Lester had hidden his
head under the bed-clothes when he heard the
bugle, and pleaded sickness when Bert Gordon and
his squad came to pull him out. “I suppose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
teachers think I feel very much disgraced because I
was left behind, but I don’t. I didn’t come here
to fight, and when my father hears of this, he will
tell me to start for home at once. But I shan’t
go until I get a good ready, and then I am going
in my own way. I am going to do something that
will make these fellows remember me. I said it
long ago, and I mean it.”</p>

<p>“It is my opinion that this day’s work will
break up this school,” observed Enoch Williams.
“I know my father will not allow me to stay here
after he hears of it.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t this be a good time to go off on our
cruise?” inquired Lester.</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” answered Jones. “I should
like to go this very night; but as things look now,
I am of the opinion that we shall have to wait
until next month. We don’t want to fail when
we make the attempt, for if we do, we shall be
watched closer than we are now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to stay here,” said Lester.
“Suppose they should need more help in the city,
and that my company should be ordered down
there?”</p>

<p>“You need not waste any time in worrying over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that,” was the encouraging reply. “Your company
is composed of nothing but raw recruits;
and even if it should be ordered there, <i>you</i>
wouldn’t go. You would be told to stay behind,
as I was.”</p>

<p>Lester found some satisfaction in this assurance,
but he found none whatever in being snubbed as
he was. Even the boys in his own company—those
who had promptly responded when ordered
to fall in the night before—would not look at him.
If two of them were talking and Lester came up
to hear what they were saying, they would turn
their backs upon him without ceremony and walk
away. All the boys who had concealed themselves
or played off sick when the false alarm was sounded,
were treated in the same way by their fellows,
and all the companionship they could find was in
the society of students who were as timid as they
were. This had at least one good effect, so Lester
thought. It brought many friends to the boys
who intended to desert the academy and run away
in the yacht, and before the day was over Lester,
Jones and Enoch had revealed their scheme to
half a dozen or more new fellows, who heartily approved
of it and promised to aid them by every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
means in their power. But after all they did not
take as much interest in, or show as much enthusiasm
for, the scheme, as Lester and the rest
thought they ought to. The strike was the all-absorbing
topic of conversation, and the possible
fate of the boys who had gone down to the city to
confront the mob, made many an anxious face.</p>

<p>Although all study was over for the day, everything
else was done as usual, but nothing was
done well. The students were thinking of something
beside their duties, and made blunders and
received reprimands without number. As the
hours wore on, the excitement gave place to alarm.
The third company ought to have reached Hamilton
at eight o’clock, if everything had gone well
with them, and now it was long after ten and not
a despatch had been received.</p>

<p>“I am really afraid something has happened to
them, Sam,” said Sergeant Gordon, as he and
Corporal Arkwright paced up and down the walk
in front of the guard-room in which sat the German
professor, who was deeply interested in his
paper. These two boys were on duty until midnight,
and they wished they were going to stay on
until morning, for they knew they could not sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
if they tried. “My brother promised to telegraph
me just as soon as he reached the city,” continued
Bert, “and he would surely have done so, if something
had not occurred to——”</p>

<p>“Corporal of the guard, No. 1,” shouted the
sentry at the gate.</p>

<p>“Zetz auber!” exclaimed the professor, throwing
down his paper. “Go out dere, gorporal.
Mebbe dot ish somedings from Meester Gellock.”</p>

<p>The corporal went, and Bert went with him.
If there were a messenger-boy at the gate, his despatch
might be from Don instead of Professor
Kellogg; but there was no messenger-boy to be
seen. On the opposite side of the tall, iron gate
were a couple of men who peered through the bars
occasionally, and then looked behind and on both
sides of them as if to make sure that there was no
one watching their movements.</p>

<p>“These fellows affirm that they are just from
the city,” said the sentry, in a husky and trembling
voice. “They have brought bad news. They
say that our boys were cut all to pieces by the
rioters.”</p>

<p>Bert’s heart seemed to stop beating. Without
waiting to ask the sentry any questions, he passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on to the gate and waited for the men to speak to
him. He could not have said a word to them to
save his life.</p>

<p>“We thought we had better come up here and
let you know about it,” said one of the visitors, at
length. “The strikers are awful mad, and declare
they are going to burn the academy.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Bert, after he had
taken time to recover his breath.</p>

<p>“We’re strikers, but we’re friends,” was the
answer. “We live here in Bridgeport and had to
strike with the rest to escape getting our heads
broken. We saw the fight to-night, but we
didn’t take any part in it.”</p>

<p>“The fight?” gasped Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes; and it was a lively one, I tell you. I
didn’t know the boys had so much pluck. But
there were three thousand of the mob and only
about eighty of them, and so they had no show.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Bert. “What became
of our boys?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know, for we lost no time in getting
out of that when we found that there were bullets
flying through the air; but some of the strikers
told us that they whipped the cadets, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
those of them who could get away ran like
sheep.”</p>

<p>“Corporal, go into the sentry’s box and get the
key,” said Bert. “I shall have to ask you to
make your report to the officer of the guard.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the man who did the talking.
“That’s what we came here for; but we want to
be as sly as we can in getting in and out, for if we
should be seen here, we’d have trouble directly.
Bridgeport is in a tumult of excitement, and there
are lots of spies here. We came up from Town
Line on a hand-car with a lot of them. The lads
must have got in some pretty good work before
they were whipped, or else the strikers would not
be so mad at them.”</p>

<p>“Was there a fight, sure enough?” said Bert,
as the corporal came up with the key and opened
the gate. He was so astounded and terrified that,
although he heard all the man said to him, he did
not seem to comprehend it.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say there was a fight. I tell you,
it must have been hot in that car, and I don’t see
how a single boy in it could possibly come out alive!”</p>

<p>“Then some of our friends must have been
hurt?” faltered Bert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course. I don’t believe a dozen of the
whole company came out uninjured.”</p>

<p>Bert wanted to ask if his informant had heard
the names of any of the wounded, but the words
he would have uttered stuck in his throat. While
he was trying to get them out he reached the
guard-room, and ushered the visitors into the
presence of Professor Odenheimer.</p>

<p>“These men, sir, desire to make report concerning
a fight that took place between our boys and
the mob at Hamilton,” said the sergeant; and
then he backed off and stood ready to hear what
they had to say in addition to what they had already
told him.</p>

<p>The excitable Prussian started as if he had been
shot. “Our poys did have a pattle?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, they did,” answered one of the men.</p>

<p>“Donder and blixen! I don’t can pelieve dot.”</p>

<p>“They say they have just come from there, sir,”
interposed Bert.</p>

<p>The professor jumped to his feet, dashed his
spectacles upon the table, and broke into a
torrent of German ejaculations indicative of the
greatest wonder and excitement. His next question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was, not “Were any of the boys injured?”
but—</p>

<p>“Did dem gadets make good fighting? Dot’s
vot I vant to know.”</p>

<p>The men replied that they had done wonders.</p>

<p>“Dot’s all right! Dot’s <i>all</i> right,” exclaimed
Mr. Odenheimer, rubbing his hands gleefully together.
“Zargeant, you and de gorporal vait oudside
and I will hear de rebort of dese men. So
dem gadets make good fighting! I been glad to
hear dot. Seet down in dem chairs and told me
all apout it.”</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers reluctantly withdrew,
and the professor was left alone with the
visitors.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE HANDS OF THE MOB.</span></h2>

<p>“Dutchy is a hard-hearted old wretch,” said
Corporal Arkwright indignantly. “He
never asked if any of our boys were wounded.”</p>

<p>“Of course he didn’t,” replied Bert. “He took
it for granted. If the fight was as desperate as
those men say it was, we shall soon have a sorrowful
report from Hamilton. I ought to write to
my mother at once, but I haven’t the courage to
do it.”</p>

<p>The boys waited outside, as they were told to
do, but they used their best endeavors to overhear
what passed between the professor and his visitors.
They had their trouble for their pains, however.
The men talked in low tones, and beyond
an occasional ebullition of wrath from Mr. Odenheimer,
who invariably spoke in German, they could
hear nothing. Presently the door opened, and the
three came out and hastened toward the academy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is fully as serious as we thought, Sam,”
said Sergeant Gordon. “They are going in to tell
their story to the superintendent.”</p>

<p>Bert never slept a wink that night. He was at
the gate at daylight, and was the first to purchase
a paper when the newsboys came around. As he
opened the sheet with trembling hands, his eye
fell upon the following paragraph:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Wednesday Morning, 3 o’clock.</span>—We have
delayed the issue of our paper until this morning,
hoping to obtain direct information from Hamilton;
but we have heard nothing but vague rumors,
which grew out of all proportion as they traveled.
That the academy boys had a brush with the
strikers is evident. They were met before reaching
the city by an immense mob, and a fight ensued,
in which some of our boys were wounded. The
following despatch, taken from last night’s <i>Town
Line Democrat</i>, despite some inaccuracies, probably
has a few grains of truth in it:</p>

<p>‘This evening, when the Bridgeport Cadets got
into Hamilton they were stopped by striking
rioters, who shoved their car upon a side track,
and then commenced stoning and shooting them.
The Cadets, after standing the fusillade for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
time, opened fire and delivered volley after volley,
wounding thirty persons and killing many. The
rioters finally succeeded in getting upon the car
and overpowering the company, capturing the
guns, and driving the boys out of the city.’</p>

<p>“Nine members of the academy company, having
become separated from their fellows in the
<i>mêlée</i>, took the back track and are expected
home to-day.”</p>

<p>After making himself master of everything in
the paper that related to the fight, Bert went into
the academy and handed the sheet to the orderly,
with the request that he would give it to the
superintendent as soon as he got up. It was probable,
he thought, that the latter would want to
do something to assist those nine boys who were
now on their way home. When they arrived he
might be able to learn something about Don; and
in the mean time he could do nothing but wait.</p>

<p>No study-call was sounded that morning, and
the day promised to be a dark and gloomy one;
but about ten o’clock little rays of sunshine began
breaking through the clouds. The first came when
the word was passed for Bert Gordon. He hurried
into the superintendent’s office and was presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with a despatch. He was about to go out with it
when the superintendent said:</p>

<p>“Read it here, sergeant. There may be news
in it, and we should like to know what it is, if you
have no objections.”</p>

<p>Bert tore open the envelope and read aloud the
following from Don, who had telegraphed at the
very earliest opportunity:</p>

<p>“Got in this morning after a night of trouble.
No violence offered in the city. I am all right,
and so is Curtis, but our unlucky friend Hop is
missing, and Egan is wounded.”</p>

<p>Every one present drew a long breath of relief
when Bert read these words. This was the first
reliable news they had received, and it removed a
heavy burden of anxiety from their minds.</p>

<p>“So it seems that the company was not cut
to pieces after all,” said the superintendent. “It
is probable that the boys were roughly handled,
but that didn’t keep them from going into the
city. I feel greatly encouraged.”</p>

<p>And so did everybody. Bert would have felt
quite at his ease if he could have got over worrying
about Hopkins and Egan. He feared the
worst. But then his fat crony was fortunate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
some respects even if he were unlucky in others,
and it was possible that he might yet turn up safe
and sound and as jolly as ever, and that Egan’s
wound might not be a serious one.</p>

<p>After that despatches came thick and fast. As
soon as they were received they were read aloud
to the students, who made the armory ring with
their yells of delight when one came from Professor
Kellogg stating that Captain Mack and his
men had behaved with the utmost gallantry.
Thirty-two of the company were fit for duty, although
they had but seventeen guns among them,
eight were slightly wounded, but, having good
care, were doing well, and the rest were missing.
They had whipped the mob twice and carried
their wounded off the field.</p>

<p>“I tell you it makes a good deal of difference
where the news comes from—from your own side
or from the enemy’s,” said Bert. “Things don’t
look as dark as they did. I wish those nine boys
who are now on the way home would hurry up. I
am impatient to talk to them.”</p>

<p>“They will soon be here,” replied one of the
students. “I heard the superintendent say that
the citizens have sent carriages after them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>While those at the academy are waiting for these
boys, let us go back to the third company and see
what really happened to them, and how they acted
when they found themselves surrounded by the
mob. Of course they did not know what was in
store for them, but the majority made up their
minds that they would be called upon to face something
decidedly unpleasant when they reached
Hamilton, for their train had hardly moved away
from the depot before it was whispered from one boy
to another that some one on the platform had been
heard to say that they (the students) were going
into a hotter place than they ever dreamed of.
Still they kept up a good heart, although they did
not at all like the looks of the crowds of men and
boys who were assembled at every station along
the road. They did not know that two unhanged
villains, Michael Lynch, the fireman of their train,
and William Long, the Western Union operator
at Bridgeport, had conspired to make their reception
at Hamilton a warmer one than they had
bargained for, by sending a despatch announcing
their departure to an office in the lower
part of the city that was in the hands of the
strikers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>For a while it looked as though the ball would
be set in motion at Town Line; for the large depot
through which their train passed was literally
packed with strikers and their aids and sympathizers,
who had a good deal to say about the
young soldiers and their object in going to the city.
But they went through without any trouble, and
when they reached a little station a few miles
beyond, Professor Kellogg telegraphed for orders.
These having been received the train moved on
again, and Captain Mack came and perched himself
upon the arm of the seat in which Don and
Egan were sitting.</p>

<p>“I tell you, fellows, this begins to look like war
times,” said he.</p>

<p>“Where are we going, and what are we to do
when we get there?” inquired Egan.</p>

<p>“We are not going into the city to-night,”
answered the captain. “We are sent down here
simply to act as guards, and if there is any fighting
to be done, the 61st will have to do it. Our
orders read in this way: ‘You will leave the train
at Hamilton creek and guard the railroad property
there during the night. Use such cars as you can,
and keep all the guards out that may be necessary.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
There are no signs of a gathering at the
creek, but in order to be on the safe side the professor
has ordered the conductor to let us out at
least a quarter of a mile from the bridge. If a
mob appears anywhere along the road, we are to
get off and form before we go up to it.”</p>

<p>There was nothing in these plans with which any
military man could have found fault. They would
have met the requirements of the case in every
particular, had it not been for the fact that Professor
Kellogg had to deal with men who were as
treacherous as the plains Indians are said to be.
There <i>was</i> a mob at the bridge, and the engineer
saw it long before he reached it. In fact he ran
through a part of it, and did not stop his train
until he was right in the midst of it. The first
thing the boys knew their car was standing still,
hoarse yells and imprecations which disturbed
their dreams for many a night afterward were
arising on all sides of them, and the rioters were
crowding upon the platforms.</p>

<p>“Lave this kyar open; we’re strong,” said a
man, in a voice which proclaimed his nationality;
and as he spoke he threw open the rear door and
placed one end of his heavy cane against it, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
same time drawing himself back out of sight as
much as he could.</p>

<p>“Attention!” shouted Captain Mack, prompted
by the professor; whereupon the young soldiers
arose and stood in front of their seats. Their bayonets
were fixed, they had loaded their guns when
they left the station at which they had stopped
for orders, and if they had been commanded to act
at once, the mob never would have gained a footing
in the car. But Mr. Kellogg did just what he
ought not to have done—he stood in the front
door, blocking the way as well as he could, and
trying to reason with the leaders of the rabble,
who demanded to know why he had come down
there, and what he was going to do. The professor
told them in reply that he was not going into
the city that night, that he had been ordered to
stop at the bridge and guard the railroad property
there, and this seemed to satisfy the mob, who
might have dispersed or gone back to Hamilton,
as their leaders promised, had it not been for one
unfortunate occurrence.</p>

<p>The attention of everybody in the car was directed
toward the men who were gathered about
the front door, and no one seemed to remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that there was a rear door at which no guard had
been stationed. The rioters at that end of the car
did not at first make themselves very conspicuous,
for they did not like the looks of the muskets the
young soldiers held in their hands; but in a very
few minutes they grew bold enough to move across
the platform in little squads, stopping on the way
to take a hasty glance at the interior, and finally
some of the reckless ones among them ventured to
come in. These were followed by others, and in
less time than it takes to tell it the aisle was
packed with strikers, who even forced their way
into the seats, crowding the boys out of their
places. About this time Mr. Kellogg happened
to look behind him, and seeing that he and his
men were at the mercy of the mob—there were
more strikers than soldiers in the car now—he
called out to the conductor, who stood on the front
platform, to go ahead with the train.</p>

<p>“I can’t do it,” was the reply. “The strikers
are in full possession of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, cut loose from us and go ahead
with your passengers,” said Professor Kellogg.
“This is as far as I want to go anyhow.”</p>

<p>“And you couldn’t go any farther if you wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to,” said a loud-mouthed striker. “We’ll have
the last one of you hung up to the telegraph poles
before morning.”</p>

<p>“Who said that?” exclaimed one of the leaders
at the front door. “Knock that man down, somebody,
or make him keep his tongue still.”</p>

<p>“Shove the car on to the switch,” yelled somebody
outside.</p>

<p>“Yes; run ’em into the switch!” yelled a
whole chorus of hoarse voices. “Dump ’em over
into the creek.”</p>

<p>Some idea of the strength of the mob may be
gained from the fact that the car, heavily loaded
as it was, began to move at once, and in a few
minutes it was pushed upon a side-track, and
brought to a stand-still on the edge of a steep
bank. While the car was in motion Don, who
had grown tired of being squeezed, sought to obtain
an easier position by stepping into his seat
and sitting down on the back of it. As he did so
he nearly lost his balance; whereupon a burly
striker, who had stepped into his place as soon as
he vacated it, reached out his hand and caught
him, in the most friendly manner.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Don, placing his hand on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
striker’s broad shoulder and steadying himself
until he was fairly settled on his perch. “Now,
since you have showed yourself to be so accommodating,
perhaps you wouldn’t mind telling me
where those fellows on the outside are shoving us
to, and what they intend to do with us.”</p>

<p>“They are going to throw you into the creek,
probably.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any sense in that,” observed Don.
“What’s the meaning of this demonstration, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“It means bread!” said the man so firmly that
Don thought it best to hold his peace.</p>

<p>There were few in the mob who seemed inclined
to talk. They answered all the questions that
were asked them, but gave their entire attention
to what was going on in the forward end of the
car. Their recognized leaders were there, talking
with Professor Kellogg, and they were waiting to
see how the conference was going to end. Those
who spoke for the strikers seemed to be intelligent
men, fully sensible of the fact that Professor Kellogg
and his company had not come to the city to
trample upon the rights of the workingman, and
for a time the prospect for a peaceful settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of the points under discussion looked very bright
indeed. But there were some abusive and violent
ones in the mob who could not be controlled, and
they always spoke up just at the wrong time.</p>

<p>“Take the bayonets off the guns!” piped a forward
youngster, who ought to have been at home
and in bed. “That’s the way we did with the 61st.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how to settle it,” said a shrill
voice, that was plainly audible in spite of the
tumult in the car and the continuous yells of the
mob outside. “If they’re friendly toward us, as
they say they are, let them give up their guns.
We’ll see that nobody harms them.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s the way to settle it,” yelled the
mob. “Let them give up their guns.”</p>

<p>This proposition startled the young soldiers.
If they agreed to it they would be powerless to defend
themselves, and what assurance had they
that the strikers would not wreak vengeance upon
them? Nothing but the word of half a dozen
men who could not have controlled the turbulent
ones among their followers, even if they had been
disposed to try. But fortunately Mr. Kellogg was
not the man they took him for. As soon as the
yells of approval had subsided so that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
make himself heard, his answer came clear and
distinct;</p>

<p>“I shall not disarm my men; you may depend
upon that.”</p>

<p>“Let’s run ’em back to Bridgeport, where they
belong,” shouted a striker.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” shouted the mob. “We
don’t want ’em here. Run ’em back where they
came from. We can easy find an engine.”</p>

<p>“I am not going back,” replied the undaunted
professor. “I was ordered to come here, and now
that I got here, I am going to stay.”</p>

<p>“Well, you shan’t stay with these guns in your
hands,” said the shrill-voiced man. “All of us
who are in favor of disarming them say ‘I.’”</p>

<p>“I! I!” was the almost unanimous response.</p>

<p>If there were any present who were opposed to
disarming the boys, they were not given an opportunity
to say so. Encouraged by their overwhelming
numbers, and by the fact that the mass of the
soldiers were mere striplings to be strangled with
a finger and thumb, the rioters went to work to
secure the muskets, and then there was a scene to
which no pen could do justice.</p>

<p>The fight, if such it could be called, was a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
unequal one. That portion of the mob which had
possession of the car, was composed almost entirely
of rolling-mill hands, and not of “lazy, ragged
tramps and boys,” as a Hamilton paper afterward
declared. They were powerful men, and the young
soldiers were like infants in their grasp. But,
taken at every disadvantage as they were, the
most of the boys gave a good account of themselves.
A few, terrified by the sight of the revolvers
and knives that were flourished before their
eyes, surrendered their weapons on demand, and
even allowed their cartridge-boxes to be cut from
their persons; but the others fought firmly to
retain possession of their guns, and gave them up
only when they were torn from their grasp. Among
the latter was Don Gordon.</p>

<p>When the proposition to disarm the boys was
put and carried, the man who was standing in
Don’s seat, and who had caught him when he
came so near losing his balance, faced about, seized
the boy’s musket, and, in spite of all Don could
do to prevent it, forced it over toward his friends
in the aisle. A dozen hands quickly laid hold of
it, but Don would not give it up. He held to it
with all his strength, until one of the mob, enraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
at his determined resistance, gave a sudden jerk,
pulling the weapon out of his hands and compelling
Don to turn a somerset over the back of his
seat.</p>

<p>One thing that encouraged Don to make so desperate
a struggle for the possession of his piece,
was the heroic conduct of a little pale-faced fellow,
Will Hovey by name, who occupied the seat in
front of him. Will didn’t look as though he had
any too much courage, but his actions proved that
he had plenty of it. He was confronted by a ruffian
big enough to eat him up, who was trying to
disarm him with one hand, while in the other he
had a formidable looking knife with a blade that
was a foot long.</p>

<p>“Give it up, I tell you,” Don heard the striker
say.</p>

<p>“I’ll not do it,” was Will’s reply. “I’ll die
first.”</p>

<p>The knife descended, and Don expected to see
the brave boy killed before his eyes; but he
dodged like a flash, just in the nick of time, and
the glittering steel passed over his shoulder, cutting
a great hole in his coat and letting out the
lining. Will lost his gun in the end, but he wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that coat to the city, and was as proud of that
rent as he would have been of a badge of honor.
He was a soldier all over, and proved it by stealing
a gun to replace the one the strikers had taken
from him.</p>

<p>When Don was pulled over the back of his seat,
he fell under the feet of a party of struggling men
and boys, who stepped upon and knocked him
about in the most unceremonious way, and it was
only after repeated efforts that he succeeded in
recovering his perpendicular. No sooner had he
arisen to an upright position than he fell into the
clutches of a striker who seized his waist-belt with
one hand and tried to cut it from him with a knife
he held in the other, being under the impression
that if he succeeded, he would gain possession of the
boy’s cartridge-box. But there’s where he missed
his guess, for the cartridge-box which hung on one
side and the bayonet scabbard that hung on the
other, were supported by breast belts; and the
waist belt was simply intended to hold them close
to the person, so that they would not fly about
too much when the wearer was moving at double
time. Don, however, did not want that belt cut,
and he determined that it should not be if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
could prevent it. The striker was larger and
much stronger than he was, but Don fought him
with so much spirit that the man finally became
enraged, and turned the knife against him. If he
had had any chance whatever to use his weapon,
he would certainly have done some damage; but
he and Don were packed in so tightly among the
strikers and the students, who were all mixed up
together now, that neither one of them had an
inch of elbow-room. The struggling crowd was
gradually working its way toward the rear door,
and Don saw that he must do something very
quickly or be dragged out of the car into the
hands of the outside mob. After trying in vain
to disarm his assailant, and to free himself from
his grasp by breaking the belt, he set to work to
unhook it; but he was knocked about so promiscuously
by the combatants on all sides of him,
that he couldn’t even do that.</p>

<p>How long the fight over the guns and cartridge-boxes
continued no one knows; and the reports in
our possession, which are full and explicit on all
other points, are silent on this. But it took the
strikers a long time to disarm the boys, and even
then they had to leave without getting all the guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to this time not a shot had been fired or a
stone thrown. The mob outside could not bombard
the car for fear of injuring some of their own
men, and the students could not shoot for the same
reason. Besides, the order not to pull a trigger
until they were told to do so was peremptory, and
in his report Professor Kellogg takes pains to say
that this command was strictly obeyed. The
order to fire on the mob would have been given
before it was but for one thing: The only officer
who had the right to give it was being choked so
that he could not utter a sound. The strikers
were quick to see that Professor Kellogg was the
head and front of the company, and believing that
if they could work their will on him, they could
easily frighten the boys into submission, they laid
hold of him and tried to drag him out of the car;
and failing in that, the door being blocked by their
own men, who were anxious to crowd in and take
a hand in the fracas, they bent the professor backward
over the arm of a seat and throttled him.
The students in his immediate vicinity defended
him with the utmost obstinacy and courage, and
a sword, and at least one bayonet, which went into
the fight bright and clean, came out stained. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
any rate the rioters did not succeed in killing the
professor, as they fully intended to do, or in dragging
him out of the door. After a desperate struggle
he succeeded in freeing himself from their
clutches, and as soon as he could speak, he called
out:</p>

<p>“Clear the car! Clear the car!”</p>

<p>This was the order the students were waiting
for, and if the order had not been so long delayed
their victory would have been more complete than
it was, for they would have had more guns to use.
They went to work at once, and the way those
rioters got out of that car must have been a surprise
to their friends on the outside. Swords,
bayonets and the butts of the muskets were freely
used, and when the last rioter had jumped from
the platform, the real business of the night commenced.
All on a sudden the windows on both
sides were smashed in, and stones, chunks of coal,
coupling-pins, bullets and buck-shot rattled into
the car like hail.</p>

<p>“Come on, me brave lads!” yelled a voice on
the outside. “Let’s have the last one of ’em out
of there an’ hang them to the brudge.”</p>

<p>A simultaneous rush was made for both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
doors, but the maddened mob had no sooner appeared
than a sheet of flame rolled toward them,
and they retreated with the utmost precipitancy.
Forbearance was no longer a virtue. His own life
and the lives of the boys under his charge were
seriously threatened now, and with the greatest
reluctance Professor Kellogg gave the order to
fire. It was obeyed, and with the most telling
effect. After repulsing three charges that were
made upon the car, the boys turned their guns
out of the windows, and firing as rapidly as they
could reload, they drove the mob over the railroad
track and forced them to take refuge behind the
embankment.</p>

<p>Although the students had full possession of
the car, their position was one of extreme danger.
They were surrounded by a rabble numbering
more than three thousand men, sixty of whom
were armed with their own muskets, while the
students had only seventeen left with which to
oppose them; the rioters were securely hidden
behind the embankment, while the car was brilliantly
lighted, and if a boy showed the top of his
cap in front of a window, somebody was sure to
see and shoot at it; and worse than all, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the mob, being afraid to run the gauntlet of the
bullets which were flying through the air from
both sides, had taken refuge under the car, and
were now shooting through the bottom of it. One
of the lieutenants was the first to discover this.
He reported it to Captain Mack, and the latter
reported it to the professor.</p>

<p>“That will never do,” said Mr. Kellogg. “We
must get out of here. Attention!”</p>

<p>The boys, who were crouched behind the seats
and firing over the backs and around the sides of
them, jumped to their feet and stepped out into
the aisle, while Don opened the door so that they
could go out.</p>

<p>“Where’s your gun, Gordon?” demanded the
professor.</p>

<p>“It was taken from me, sir,” replied Don.
“But I’ll have another before many minutes.”</p>

<p>Don knew very well that somebody would get
hurt when they got out on the railroad, and if he
were not hit himself, he wanted to be ready to
take the gun from the hands of the first boy who
<i>was</i> hit, provided that same boy had a gun. He
secured a musket in this way, and he did good
service with it, too.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">WELCOME HOME.</span></h2>

<p>Don Gordon’s assailant kept him exceedingly
busy in warding off the thrusts of
the knife, and the boy had a lively time of it
before he could escape from his clutches. When
the students went to work to clear the car, Don
hoped that the man would become frightened and
let go his hold; but instead of that, he seemed all
the more determined to pull his captive out of the
door. In spite of his resistance Don was dragged
as far as the stove, and there he made a desperate
and final effort to escape. Placing his foot against
the side of the door he threw his whole weight
upon the belt, jerked it from the man’s grasp and
fell in the aisle all in a heap. When he scrambled
to his feet the car was clear of strikers, his antagonist
being the last to jump from the platform.
Don was surprised to see how few there were left
of the students. When they left Bridgeport there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
were more of them than the seats could accommodate;
but there were only a handful of them
remaining, and they were gathered in the forward
end of the car. Where were the others? While
Don stood in the aisle debating this question, two
or three boys arose from their hiding-places under
the seats and hurried past him.</p>

<p>“Come on, Gordon,” said one. “The way is
clear now.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Anywhere to get out of the mob. Lots of our
fellows have left the car and taken to their heels.
Come on.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go out there,” cried Don. “You will
be safer if you stay with the crowd.”</p>

<p>The boys, who were so badly frightened that
they hardly knew what they were doing, paid no
attention to him. They ran out of the car, and a
minute later the rioters made their first charge,
and the order was given to fire. This put life into
Don, who lost no time in getting out of the range
of the bullets in his companions’ muskets. Stepping
out of the aisle he made his way toward the
forward end of the car, by jumping from the back
of one seat to the back of another. As he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
passing a window a coupling-pin, or some other
heavy missile, came crushing through it, barely
missing him and filling his clothing with broken
glass. If it had hit him, it would probably have
ended his career as a military student then and
there.</p>

<p>Reaching the forward end of the car in safety
the first thing Don saw, as he dropped to his knee
by Egan’s side, was a loaded musket; and the
second was one of the Bridgeport students lying
motionless under a seat. His face was too pale and
his wide-open eyes were too void of expression to
belong to a living boy, and Don straightway came
to the conclusion that he was dead.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” was his mental comment.
“There’ll be a sad home somewhere when the particulars
of this night’s work get into the papers.
He doesn’t need his musket any more, so I will
use it in his stead.”</p>

<p>Don secured his musket in time to assist in
repulsing every charge the mob made upon the
car, and then, like the others, he began firing from
the windows. While he was thus engaged one of
the lieutenants passed along the aisle, and discovering
a student lying prone under a seat, he bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
down and looked at him. Like Don, he thought,
at first, that the boy was dead; but upon closer
examination he found that there was plenty of life
in him.</p>

<p>“What are you doing there?” demanded the
young officer, indignantly. “Get up and go to
work. Where’s your gun?”</p>

<p>“Gordon’s got it,” was the faint reply.</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked around and saw Don in
the act of firing his piece out of the window.
After he made his shot, the officer asked him
whose gun he was using.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Don. “I found it
on the floor, and thought it might as well take
part in this fight as to lie idle there.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; but it belongs to this man.
Hand it over.”</p>

<p>Don was glad to know that his comrade was not
injured, but he was reluctant to surrender the
musket into the hands of one who had showed no
disposition to use it when he had it. He gave it
up, however, and then crouched behind a seat and
passed out cartridges to Egan and Curtis, who
fired as fast as they could load. Both these boys
had won the marksman’s badge at five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
yards, and it was not likely that all their shots
were thrown away.</p>

<p>About this time report was made that some of
the rioters had taken refuge under the car and
were shooting up through the floor, and the professor
determined to abandon his position. The company
was called to attention, Don Gordon opened
the door, as we have recorded, and when the order
was given they left the car on a run, Don being
the fourth to touch the ground. After moving
down the track a short distance they came to a
halt and faced toward the rioters, who arose from
their places of concealment and rushed over the
embankment in a body, evidently with the intention
of annihilating the students. In fact they
told the boys as they came on that they were going
to “wipe the last one of ’em out,” but they
did not do it. The young soldiers were as steady
as veterans, and one volley was enough to scatter
the rioters, and send them in confusion to their
hiding-places. But the students did not escape
unscathed. As Don stood there on the track offering
a fair target to the rifles of the mob, and
unable to fire a single bullet in response to those
that whistled about his ears, he heard a suppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
exclamation from somebody, and turned quickly
about to see the boy who stood on his left, bent
half double and clasping both his hands around
his leg.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it,” said he, as Don sprang to his
assistance.</p>

<p>“Well, you take it pretty coolly,” replied the
other. “Come down out of sight. You’ve no
business up here now that you are shot.”</p>

<p>After leading his injured comrade to a place of
safety behind the embankment, Don returned to
the track just in time to receive in his arms the
boy who stood on his right and who clapped his
hand to his breast and reeled as if he were about
to fall. That was the narrowest escape that Don
ever had. If he had been in line, where he
belonged, the bullet which struck this boy’s breast-plate
and made an ugly wound in his chest, would
have hit Don squarely in the side.</p>

<p>The wounded boy had a gun, and Don lost no
time in taking possession of it. After seeing that
the owner was cared for by some of the unarmed
students, Don went back to his place in line, where
he remained just long enough to fire one round,
when the company was ordered off the track<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
behind the embankment, and an inspection of
boxes was held. To their great astonishment the
young soldiers found that they had not more than
two or three cartridges remaining. As it was impossible
for them to hold their ground with so
small a supply of ammunition, Mr. Kellogg
thought it best to draw off while he could. The
wounded were sent to the rear in charge of
the boys who had lost their guns in the car, after
which the company climbed the fence and struck
off through an oat-field toward the road. Seeing
this retrograde movement the mob made another
charge, but one volley sufficed to check it. If the
boys were whipped (as a Hamilton paper, which
was cowardly enough to pander to the mob
and to extol its heroism afterward declared they
were) they did not know it, and neither did the
rioters, who took pains after that to keep out of
sight. They remained by the car, which they
afterward used to carry their wounded to the
city, and the students saw them no more that
night.</p>

<p>It was during this short halt that Don Gordon,
after firing his single round, was approached by
Curtis and Egan, one of whom held a musket in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
each hand, while the other had his fingers tightly
clasped around his wrist. The latter was Egan,
and his left hand was covered with blood.</p>

<p>“Have you got a spare handkerchief about you,
Gordon?” said he. “I’m hit.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Don. “When did
you get it?”</p>

<p>“Just now. Curtis had a loud call too,” said
Egan, nodding toward his friend. “His plume
was shot out of his cap.”</p>

<p>“Let me look at your hand,” said Don, drawing
a couple of handkerchiefs from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s no artery cut, for the blood comes
out in drops and not in jets,” answered Egan.
“But I am afraid my little finger has gone up.
I have bled for my country and you haven’t.”</p>

<p>“And what’s more, I don’t want to,” said Don.</p>

<p>The latter bandaged the wounded hand as well
as he could, and the line moved on across the oat-field.
On the way the boy who had been shot
through the leg, gave out and had to be carried.
The other held up bravely, making frequent and
clamorous demands for his gun, and announcing
his readiness, severely wounded as he was, to whip
the boy who stole it from him. Don kept a still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
tongue in his head. He had the gun, and being
in a better condition to use it than the owner was,
he determined to hold fast to it.</p>

<p>When they reached the road they tore a panel
or two of the fence to pieces to make a litter for
the boy who had given out, and here they were
joined by ten or a dozen of their comrades who
had left the car by the rear door. By some extraordinary
streak of good luck, such as might not
have fallen to them again in a thousand years,
they had succeeded in escaping the mob and finding
refuge in a culvert under the railroad. They
brought two wounded boys with them, one of
whom had been struck in the eye with a buck-shot,
while the other had had his scalp laid open
by a vicious blow from the butt of a musket as he
was jumping from the car.</p>

<p>“When we heard you going across the field we
came out,” said one of the new-comers, who was
delighted to find himself among friends once more.
“There were strikers in the culvert, too, but they
didn’t bother us, for they were as badly frightened
as we were. If they had known that there was
going to be a fight they wouldn’t have come near
the bridge. They said so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Seen anything of Hop?” asked Don, as soon
as he had satisfied himself that his fat friend was
not with the party.</p>

<p>“Not lately,” was the reply, “but I guess he’s
all right. The last time I put eyes on him he was
going up the track toward Bridgeport, beating the
time of Maud S. all to pieces. If he kept on he’s
at the academy by this time. I always had an
idea that I could outrun Hop, but when he passed
me I thought I was standing still.”</p>

<p>“Were there any strikers after him?”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t one in sight. When you fellows
in the car got fairly to work, you kept such a
fusillade that they were afraid to show their
heads.”</p>

<p>By this time the litter was completed, and the
wounded boy being placed upon it, the students
resumed their march, stopping at the first house
they came to, which proved to be a little German
inn. The hospitable proprietor gave up his house
to them; guards were posted at once; a good
Samaritan, who was also a surgeon, promptly
made his appearance; the wounded were tenderly
cared for; and one of the corporals exchanged his
uniform for a citizen’s suit, went into the city, reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the fight, and in due time returned with
orders for the company to march in and report at
the railroad depot.</p>

<p>When morning came the good Samaritan came
also, accompanied by a liberal supply of hot coffee
and a substantial breakfast, which were served
out to the boys while they were sitting in the
shade of the trees opposite the inn. The doctor
took the wounded home with him to be cared for
until they could be sent back to Bridgeport; and
the others, having broken their fast, shouldered
their guns and set out for Hamilton.</p>

<p>Don Gordon afterward said that his courage
had never been so severely tested as it was that
morning. On their way to the depot the students
passed through the lower portion of the city and
through the coal-yards in which the hands had just
struck. Thousands of tons of coal were piled on
each side of the narrow street, and on the top of
these piles stood the striking workmen, who, outnumbering
the boys more than twenty to one, and
having every advantage of them in position, could
have annihilated them in a minute’s time if they
had made the attempt. It required all the nerve
Don possessed to march through there with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
eyes straight to the front, and his hair seemed to
rise on end whenever he heard one of the men call
out to his comrades:</p>

<p>“Thim’s the fellers, b’ys. Have a bit of coal
at thim.”</p>

<p>Some of the men held chunks of coal in their
hands, but they did not throw them. No doubt
there were those among them who had been in the
fight the night before, and who knew that the
boys would defend themselves if they were crowded
upon. They passed the coal-yards in safety, and
marched into the depot, where they found a portion
of the 61st under arms, together with several
companies of militia, which had been sent there
from the neighboring towns. When they stacked
arms in the rear of one of the companies which
held the left of the line, every boy drew a long
breath of relief, and Don hurried off to find a telegraph
office.</p>

<p>But little duty was imposed upon the students
that day, partly because of their rough experience
of the previous night, and partly for the reason
that the mob had threatened vengeance upon
them—particularly upon Professor Kellogg, who
conducted the defence, and upon Captain Mack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and the boy with the stained bayonet who had so
gallantly defended their leader when the rioters
tried to kill him. As one of the students afterward
remarked, they loafed about like a lot of
tramps, eating and sleeping as they do, and looking
quite as dirty. As the hours wore away the
mob began gathering in front of the depot, and once
when Don looked out, he could see nothing but
heads as far as his eyes could reach. There were
between eight and ten thousand of them, and opposed
to them there were less than three hundred
muskets. They were kept in check by double
lines of sentries which they could have swept away
like chaff if they had possessed the courage to attempt
it.</p>

<p>With the night came more excitement. Reinforcements
began to arrive. Squads of men who
had been sent off on detached duty came in, followed
by strong delegations from the Grand Army.
There were three false alarms, the last of which
created some confusion. Some uneasy sleeper,
while rolling about on his hard bed, managed to
kick over a stack of muskets. One of them, which
its careless owner had not left at a half-cock, as
he ought to have done, exploded with a ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
report that brought the different companies to
their feet and into the ranks in short order. The
company that created the confusion was stationed
directly in front of the Bridgeport boys. Some
of its members, believing that the mob was upon
them, ran for dear life, deserting their arms and
rushing pell-mell through the ranks of the students,
knocking them out of their places as fast as
they could get into them.</p>

<p>This was an opportunity that was too good to be
lost. Here were guns, scattered about over the floor,
and no one to use them. To snatch them up and
remove and throw away the slings that belonged
to them, thus making their identification a matter
of impossibility, was the work of but a few seconds.
Will Hovey was the one who set the example,
others were quick to follow it, and no one
noticed what they were doing. When order had
been restored and the ranks formed, there were
eight men in one company who could not find
their weapons, and as many boys in another who
held in their hands muskets that did not belong
to them.</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Don to himself. “If our
company gets into another tight place, I hope we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
shall have somebody besides these men to back us.
They are very pretty fellows, well up in the school
of the company, and all that, but they don’t seem
to have much pluck.”</p>

<p>The night passed without further trouble, the
forenoon came and went, and at three o’clock the
49th, of Auburn, came in. The train that brought
them to the city was stopped by the strikers,
who refused to allow it to go any further. The
colonel said he didn’t care—that he had just as
soon walk as ride—and ordered his men to disembark.</p>

<p>If the rioters had never before been fully satisfied
that their day was passed, they must have seen
it now. Instead of one company there were several
that got out of the cars—four hundred and ninety
men, in fact, who stood there with their bayonets
fixed and their pieces loaded, all ready for a fight
if the rioters wanted it. But they didn’t. Having
been so severely handled by only seventeen
boys, that they dared not pursue them when they
left the field, it was not likely that they were
anxious for a collision with this splendid body of
men, many of whom were veterans. The leaders
held a consultation, and seeing that they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
not help themselves, they finally concluded that
the regiment might proceed.</p>

<p>A short time after it came into the depot, the
Bridgeport boys and two other companies marched
out, directing their course toward the Arsenal,
which was located on one of Hamilton’s principal
business streets. Now came another test of their
courage. The sound of the drums served as a
signal to the mob, which congregated in immense
numbers, and marched with the troops to their
destination. Some of them carried clubs and stones
in their hands, and loud threats were made against
the students, who were repeatedly assured that not
one of them would ever leave the city alive. If
they had been alone they would probably have had
another fight on their hands; but they had a hundred
and sixty men to back them, and that number,
added to their own, made a larger force than
the mob cared to face in battle.</p>

<p>They took supper at the Arsenal, where they
remained until midnight, when they were ordered
to fall in without the least noise. They obeyed,
lost in wonder, leaving the drill-room so silently
that the men who were slumbering on each side of
them did not know they were gone until daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
came to reveal the fact, and when they reached
the gate they found an immense police-van waiting
for them. Into this they crowded and were
driven slowly up the street, Professor Kellogg and
Captain Mack going on ahead to see that the way
was clear.</p>

<p>“Where are you taking us?” whispered Don to
the driver.</p>

<p>“To the Penitentiary,” was the guarded response.</p>

<p>“Going to lock us up there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; the last one of you.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To punish you for shooting at the mob last
night.”</p>

<p>“They’ll give us plenty to eat, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; all you want.”</p>

<p>“Do they look for any trouble among the prisoners?”</p>

<p>“I think so; at any rate you are sent up there
at the mayor’s request. He said he wanted men
there who were not afraid to shoot, and such men
he wanted well fed.”</p>

<p>This was a compliment to the company, and a
decided indorsement of the manner in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
had conducted themselves during the fight with
the mob. To quote from some of the members, they
had a “soft thing” while they remained at the
Penitentiary. There were about four hundred
convicts there, but they knew better than to attempt
an outbreak, and all the boys had to do was
to keep themselves clean, eat, sleep, and stand
guard. Having made themselves famous they
received many calls during their two days’ stay at
the prison, and these visitors did not come empty-handed.
The stockings, handkerchiefs, collars,
lemons and other needful things they were
thoughtful enough to bring with them, were
gratefully accepted by the young soldiers, who
begged for papers, and wanted to know all that
was going on outside. They were gratified to
learn that the back-bone of the riot was broken;
that the strikers were anxious to go to work; that
trains were running on some of the roads; and
that the hour of their release was close at hand.</p>

<p>It came early on Saturday morning, when they
were ordered to draw cartridges and fall in for a
march to the skating-rink, which was now used as
military headquarters, and which they reached
without any mishap, the streets being free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
any thing that looked like a mob. As they
marched into the rink a soldier called out: “Three
cheers for the Bridgeport boys!” and the lusty
manner in which they were given proved that their
comrades were entirely satisfied with what they
had done.</p>

<p>Their departure from Hamilton, which was ordered
at eleven o’clock, was in keeping with the
treatment they had received from all the officers
and military during their entire stay. They were
escorted to the depot by two companies, which
formed in line and saluted them as they passed
by. After taking leave of many new-made friends
they boarded the car which had been set apart for
them (it was guarded at both doors this time, although
there was no necessity for it) and were
whirled away toward home, their journey being enlivened
by songs, speeches and cheers for everybody
who had borne his part in the fight. When the
whistle sounded for Bridgeport one of the students
thrust his head out of a window, but almost
instantly pulled it back again to exclaim:</p>

<p>“Great Moses! What a crowd!”</p>

<p>But it was one the boys were not afraid of. As
soon as the train came to a stand-still they left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the car, and marching in columns of fours, moved
through long lines of firemen and students who
had assembled to welcome them home, the firemen
standing with uncovered heads and the students
presenting arms. The cross-roads, as well as the
roads leading from the depot to the village, were
crowded with carriages, all filled to their utmost
capacity with ladies and gentlemen, who waved
their handkerchiefs and hats, and greeted them
with every demonstration of delight.</p>

<p>“Halt here, captain,” said the marshal of the
day, when the boys reached the head of the line.</p>

<p>“Where’s Professor Kellogg?” asked Mack,
looking around.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Halt here, and come to a left
face.”</p>

<p>When the order was obeyed, the spokesman of
a committee of reception, which had been appointed
by the citizens, mounted upon a chair
and took off his hat; whereupon Captain Mack
brought his men to parade rest to listen to his
speech. It was short but eloquent, and went
straight to the hearts of those to whom it was addressed,
with the exception, perhaps, of Captain
Mack. He knew that somebody would be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to respond, and while he pretended to be listening
with all his ears, he was looking nervously around
to find Mr. Kellogg. But that gentleman was
seated in the superintendent’s carriage a little distance
away, looking serenely on, and Mack was
left to his own resources, which, so far as speech-making
was concerned, were few indeed. When
the speaker had complimented them in well-chosen
words for the gallantry they had displayed in the
fight, and told them how proud his fellow-citizens
were to say that the company that struck the first
blow in defence of law and order in Hamilton
came from their little town, he got down from his
chair, and everybody looked at Captain Mack.</p>

<p>The young officer blushed like a girl as he
stepped out of the ranks with his cap in his hand.
He managed to make those of the crowd who
could hear him understand that he and his company
were much gratified by their reception,
which was something they had not dreamed of,
and delighted to know that their conduct as soldiers
was approved by their friends at home; and
then, not knowing what else to say, he broke out
with—</p>

<p>“I can’t make a speech, gentlemen of the committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
but my boys can holler, and I’ll prove it.
Three cheers and a tiger for the gentleman who
has so cordially greeted us, for the other gentlemen
composing the committee, and for every man,
woman and <i>baby</i> who has come out to welcome us
home.”</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, and the
citizens replied with “three times three.” When
the band struck up, the line was formed under
direction of the marshal and moved toward the
park. The church bells were rung, the solitary
field-piece of which the village could boast, and
which was brought out only on state occasions,
thundered out a greeting every minute, and the
crowds that met them at every turn cheered themselves
hoarse. Mottoes and bunting were lavishly
displayed, and Main-street was spanned by two
large flags, to which was attached a white banner
having an inscription that sent a thrill of pride to
the breasts of the boys, who now read it for the
first time—</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Welcome!</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>We honor those who do their duty.</i>”</p>

<p>On arriving at the park the arms were stacked,
the ranks broken, and fifteen minutes were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
for hand-shaking; and cordial as the formal reception
was, it bore no comparison to the hearty
personal welcome that was extended to each and
every one of the third company boys, who never
knew until that moment how many warm friends
they had in Bridgeport. Among those who came
up to shake hands with Don Gordon and Curtis
was a fellow who was dressed in the academy uniform,
who walked with a cane and wore a slipper
on his left foot. It was Courtland Hopkins.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOPKINS’S EXPERIENCE.</span></h2>

<p>“Boys, I am delighted to see you home again,
safe and sound,” said Hopkins, putting his
cane under his arm and shaking hands with both
his friends at once. “I tell you we have been
troubled about you, for some of us who returned
the second day after the fight, heard the rioters
say that you would never leave the city alive.”</p>

<p>“We heard them say so, too,” replied Curtis.
“But we’re here all the same. Hallo, Bert. And
there’s Egan. How’s your hand, old fellow?
Lost that little finger yet?”</p>

<p>“No; and I don’t think I’ll have to. Why
didn’t you let us know that you were coming?”</p>

<p>“You did know it, or else you couldn’t have
met us at the depot,” answered Don, after he had
returned his brother’s greeting.</p>

<p>“I mean that you ought to have sent us word
this morning,” said Egan. “The ladies would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
have got up a good supper for you if they had had
time to do it.”</p>

<p>“We should have done full justice to it, for we
had an early breakfast and no dinner,” Curtis remarked.
“But you have not yet told us what is the
matter with you, Hop. I hope you were not shot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It is nothing more serious than a
sprained ankle,” replied Hopkins.</p>

<p>“And ‘thereby hangs a tale,’” added Egan.
“I’ll tell you all about it when we get up to the
academy. Hop showed himself a hero if he did
run out of the back door.”</p>

<p>“How did you get back to Bridgeport?” inquired
Don.</p>

<p>“I went home with the doctor on the morning
that you fellows started for Hamilton, you know,”
replied Egan. “Well, as soon as he had dressed
my hand and the wounds of some of the other
boys who were able to walk, we went up the track
to the next station, and there we telegraphed for
a carriage. To tell the truth I never expected to
get home, for the rioters were scouring the country
in search of us. We heard of them at every
house along the road, and everybody cautioned us
to look out for ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>During a hurried conversation with their friends,
Don and Curtis learned that the people of Bridgeport
knew as much about the fight as they did
themselves. Perhaps they knew more, for they
had heard both sides of the story. The students
who came home the day after the fight—the missing
ones had all reported with the exception of
three, whose wounds were so severe that they
could not be brought from the city—had given a
correct version of the affair and described the part
that every boy took in it. All those who had done
their duty like men were known to the citizens,
and so were those who gave up their guns when
the strikers demanded them. The boys who did
the fighting, however, had not a word to say regarding
the behavior of their timid comrades.
They had an abundance of charity for them.</p>

<p>“We don’t blame them for being frightened,”
Don and Curtis often said. “There isn’t a boy in
the company who wouldn’t have been glad to get
out of that car if he could. When you have been
placed in just such a situation yourselves, you will
know how we felt; until then, you have no business
to sit in judgment upon those who are said to
have shown the white feather.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The fifteen minutes allotted for hand-shaking
having expired, the students fell in and set out
for the academy. As they marched through the
gate the bell in the cupola rung out a joyful greeting,
the artillery saluted them, and the boys in the
first, second and fourth companies presented arms.
They moved at once to the armory, and after listening
to a stirring speech from the superintendent
the ranks were broken, and their campaign
against the Hamilton rioters was happily ended.</p>

<p>“And I, for one, never want to engage in
another,” said Captain Mack, as he and Don and
Curtis set out in search of Egan and Hopkins.
“Have you heard some of the fellows say that
they wish they had been there?”</p>

<p>Yes, they and all the returned soldiers had heard
a good deal of such talk from boys who would have
died before giving up their guns, and who were
loud in their criticisms of Mr. Kellogg, who ought
to have stopped the train at least half a mile from
the mob, and fired upon it the moment it appeared.
What a chance this would have been for Lester
Brigham, if he had only been in a situation to improve
it! If he had never known before that he
made a great mistake by feigning illness on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
night the false alarm was sounded, he knew it
now. He could not conceal the disgust he felt
whenever he saw a third-company boy surrounded
by friends who were listening eagerly to his description
of the fight. Such sights as these made
him all the more determined to get away from the
academy where he had always been kept in the
background in spite of his efforts to push himself
to the front. And worse than all, there was Don
Gordon, who had come home with the marks of a
rioter’s knife on his coat and belt, who had behaved
with the coolness of a veteran, and showed
no more fear than he would have exhibited if he
had been engaged in a game of snow-ball.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he was under a seat more than half
the time, and that nobody noticed him,” said Lester,
spitefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” said Jones. “Gordon isn’t
that sort of a fellow. Well, they have had their
fun, and ours is yet to come. There will be a jolly
lot of us sent down at the end of the term. What
do you suppose your governor will say to you?”</p>

<p>“Not a word,” replied Lester, confidently. “He
didn’t send me here to risk life and limb by fighting
strikers who have done nothing to me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
when he gets the letters I have written him, he
will tell me to start for home at once.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll not go?” said Jones.</p>

<p>“Not until we have had our picnic,” replied
Lester.</p>

<p>“Perhaps your father won’t care to have Jones
and me visit you,” remarked Enoch.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes he will. He told me particularly to
invite a lot of good fellows home with me, and he
will give you a cordial welcome. I haven’t got
a shooting-box, but I own a nice tent, and that
will do just as well. I will show you some duck-shooting
that will make you open your eyes.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Enoch. “I’ll go, according
to promise, and you must be sure and visit me in
my Maryland home next year. Both the Gordons
and Curtis will visit Egan at that time, and unless
I am much mistaken, we can make things lively
for them.”</p>

<p>“Nothing would suit me better,” returned Lester.
“I hate all that crowd. Don and Bert went
back on me as soon as they got me here, and I’ll
never rest easy until I get a chance to square yards
with them.”</p>

<p>(Lester learned this from Enoch. He remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
all the nautical expressions he heard, and
used them as often as he could, and sometimes
without the least regard for the fitness of things.
He hoped in this way to make his companions believe
that he was a sailor, and competent to command
the yacht during their proposed cruise.)</p>

<p>The conversation just recorded will make it
plain to the reader that Lester and some of his
particular friends, following in the lead of Don
and Bert Gordon and <i>their</i> friends, had made arrangements
to spend a portion of their vacation in
visiting one another. They carried out their
plans, too, and perhaps we shall see what came
of it.</p>

<p>When Mack and the rest found Hopkins and
Egan, they went up to the latter’s room, where
they thought they would be allowed to talk in
peace; but some of the students saw them go in
there, and in less time than it takes to write it,
the little dormitory was packed until standing-room
was at a premium. The boys were full of
questions. What one did not think of another
did, and it was a long time before Don could say
a word about Hopkins’s experience, which Egan
related substantially as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>To begin with, Hopkins did not leave the car because
he wanted to, but because he couldn’t help
himself. When the rioters voted to disarm the
young soldiers, half a dozen pairs of ready hands
were laid upon his musket, but Hopkins wouldn’t
give it up. Threats, and the sight of the revolvers
and knives that were brandished before his face, had
no effect upon him; but he could not contend
against such overwhelming odds, with the least
hope of success. He was jerked out into the aisle
in spite of all he could do to prevent it, and
dragged toward the door. When the students
turned their bayonets and the butts of their pieces
against their assailants, the latter made a frantic
rush for the door, and Hopkins was wedged in so
tightly among them, that he could not get out.
His gun was pulled from his grasp, and Hopkins,
finding his hands at liberty, seized the arm of
the nearest seat in the hope of holding himself
there until the mob had passed out of the car;
but the pressure from the forward end was too
great for his strength. He lost his hold, was carried
out of the door by the rush of the rioters,
who, intent on saving themselves, took no notice
of him, and crowded him off the platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“But before I went, I was an eye-witness to a
little episode in which our friend Egan bore a
part, and which he seems inclined to omit,” interrupted
Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Now, Hop, I’ve got the floor,” exclaimed Egan,
who was lying at his ease on his room-mate’s bed.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you have. There’s no gag-law
here.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Hop,” shouted the boys.</p>

<p>“It will take me but a moment,” said Hopkins,
while Egan settled his uninjured hand under his
head with a sigh of resignation. “When the mob
went to work to disarm us, one big fellow stepped
up to Egan and took hold of his gun. ‘Lave me
this; I’m Oirish,’ said he. ‘I’m Irish too,’ said
Egan. ‘Take that with me compliments and lave
me the gun;’ and he hit the striker a blow in the
face that lifted him from his feet and would have
knocked him out of the front door, if there hadn’t
been so many men and boys in the way. That
fellow must have thought he had been kicked by
a mule. At any rate he did not come back after
the gun, and Egan was one of the few who got
out of the car as fully armed as he was when he
went in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Hopkins could be irresistibly comical when he
tried, and his auditors shouted until the room
rang again. They knew that his story was exaggerated,
but it amused them all the same. Egan
<i>did</i> say that he was Irish (Hopkins often told him
that if he ever denied his nationality his name
would betray him), and it was equally true that
he floored the man who demanded his gun, and
with him one or two of his own company boys
who happened to be in the way; but he said nothing
about “compliments” nor did he imitate the
striker’s way of talking. Among those who felt
some of the force of that blow, was Captain
Mack.</p>

<p>“That explains how I got knocked down,” said
he. “The rioters were trying to drag the professor
out of the car, and we were doing all we could
to protect him, when all at once some heavy body
took me in the back, and the first thing I knew I
was sprawling on the floor. I thought I should
be trampled to death before I could get up.”</p>

<p>When Hopkins struck the ground he stood still
and waited for some of the mob to come and
knock him on the head; but seeing that they
were looking out for themselves, and that some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
his comrades were making good time up the track
in the direction of Bridgeport, he started too,
doing much better running than he did when
he stole farmer Hudson’s jar of buttermilk, and
passing several of the company who were in full
flight. The bullets sang about his ears and
knocked up the dirt before and behind him, and
Hopkins began looking about for a place of concealment.
Seeing that some of his company ran
down from the track and disappeared very suddenly
when they reached a certain point a short
distance in advance of him, Hopkins stopped to
investigate. He found that they had sought
refuge in a culvert, which afforded them secure
protection from the bullets; but Hopkins was inclined
to believe that in fleeing from one danger
they had run plump into another. There were
strikers as well as students in there; and as he
halted at the mouth of the culvert he heard a
hoarse voice say:</p>

<p>“You soldier boys had better not stop here.
You have made the mob mad, and as soon as they
get through with those fellows in the car, they are
going to spread themselves through the country
and make an end of everybody who wears the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
academy uniform. I heard some of them say so,
and I am talking for your good.”</p>

<p>“And I will act upon your advice,” said Hopkins
to himself. “It is a dangerous piece of business
to go along that railroad-track, but I don’t
see how I am going to help it.”</p>

<p>It proved to be a more dangerous undertaking
than the boy thought it was. Death by the bullets
which constantly whistled over the track, was
not the only peril that threatened him now. Believing
that the main body of their forces could
keep the professor and his handful of students
in the car until their cartridges were expended,
after which it would be an easy matter to drag
them out and hang them as they fully meant
to do, the rioters had sent off a strong detachment
to look after the boys who had escaped
from the rear of the car. Hopkins could see
them running through the fields with the intention
of getting ahead of the fugitives and surrounding
them.</p>

<p>“That’s a very neat plan, but I don’t think it
will work,” said Hopkins, as he drew himself together
and prepared for another foot-race. “I
wish I had known this before I left the culvert so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that I could have told—I’ll go back and tell them
if I lose my only chance for escape by it.”</p>

<p>Hopkins turned quickly about, but saw at a
glance that there was no need that he should
waste valuable time by going back to the culvert.
The boys were leaving it in a body and making
their way across a field. They were going to join
their comrades who had left the car, but Hopkins
did not know it, for he could not see the company,
it being concealed from his view by some thick
bushes which grew on that side of the track.</p>

<p>“They’re all right,” said Hopkins, “but it
seems to me they are taking a queer way to get
home. I’ll stick to the track, because it leads to
Bridgeport by the most direct route. Now then
for a run! Hallo, here! What’s the matter with
you, Stanley?”</p>

<p>While Hopkins was talking in this way to himself,
he was flying up the track at a rate of speed
which promised to leave the fleetest of the flanking
party far behind; but before he had run a
hundred yards, he came upon a student who was
sitting on the end of one of the ties with his head
resting on his hands. As Hopkins drew nearer he
saw that the boy had bound his handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
around his leg just above his knee, and that it was
stained with blood.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” repeated Hopkins.</p>

<p>“I’m shot and can’t go any farther,” was the
faint reply.</p>

<p>“When did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Just as I jumped from the car.”</p>

<p>“Well, get up and try again. You must go
on, for if you stay here you are done for. Look
there,” said Hopkins, directing the boy’s attention
to the rioters who were trying to surround them.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. I ran till I dropped, and I
couldn’t do more, could I? I am afraid my leg
is broken. Take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will, and of you, too,” replied Hopkins.
“Get up. Now balance yourself on one foot,
throw your arms over my shoulders and I will
carry you.”</p>

<p>The wounded boy, who had given up in despair,
began to take heart now. He did just as Hopkins
told him, and the former walked off with him
on his back as if his weight were no incumbrance
whatever. He did not run, but he moved with a
long, swinging stride which carried him and his
burden over the ground as fast as most boys would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
care to walk with no load at all. The mob followed
them until they came to the creek which was
too wide to jump and too deep to ford, and there
they abandoned the pursuit. At all events Hopkins
and Stanley saw no more of them that night.</p>

<p>“Look out,” said Stanley, suddenly. “There’s
one of them right ahead of us.”</p>

<p>Hopkins looked up and saw a man standing on
the track. The manner of his appearance seemed
to indicate that he had been hidden in the bushes
awaiting their approach.</p>

<p>“You had better put me down and save yourself,”
whispered Stanley, as Hopkins came to a
halt wondering what he was going to do now.
“If you get into a fight with him I can’t help you.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t pick you up to drop you again at the
first sign of danger,” was the determined reply.
“I wish I had a club or a stone. You don’t see
one anywhere, do you?”</p>

<p>“Say, boss,” said the man, in guarded tones.</p>

<p>“Bully for him; he’s a darkey,” exclaimed
Hopkins. “We have nothing to fear.”</p>

<p>“Say, boss,” said the man again, as he came
down the track, “Ise a friend. Don’t shoot.”</p>

<p>“All right, uncle. Come on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s de matter wid you two?”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing the matter with me,” answered
Hopkins, “but this boy is shot. Can you
do anything for him?”</p>

<p>“Kin I do sumpin fur de soldiers?” exclaimed
the negro. “’Course I kin, kase didn’t dey do a
heap fur me when de wah was here? I reckon
mebbe I’d best take him down to de house whar
de women folks is.”</p>

<p>“Handle him carefully,” said Hopkins. “He’s
got a bad leg.”</p>

<p>The negro, who was a giant in strength as well
as stature, raised the wounded boy in his arms as
easily as if he had been an infant, and carried him
up the track until he came to a road which led
back into the woods where his cabin was situated.
Here they found several colored people of both
sexes who had gathered for mutual protection, and
who greeted the boys with loud exclamations of
wonder and sympathy.</p>

<p>“Hush yer noise dar,” commanded the giant,
who answered to the name of Robinson. “Don’t
yer know dat dem strikers is all fru de country,
an’ dat some of ’em was hyar not mor’n ten minutes
ago?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not here at this house?” exclaimed Hopkins,
in alarm.</p>

<p>Yes, they had been there at the house, and in it
and all over it, so Robinson said, looking for the
boys who had escaped by the rear door. They
might return at any moment, but he (Robinson)
would do the best he could for them. He couldn’t
fight the mob, as he would like to, but perhaps he
could keep the boys concealed.</p>

<p>“What do you think they would do with us if
they found us?” inquired Stanley.</p>

<p>Robinson couldn’t say for certain, but the men
who came to his house were angry enough to do
almost anything. They were all armed, and some
of them carried ropes in their hands. This proved
that their threat to hang the young soldiers was
no idle one.</p>

<p>The first thing Robinson did was to look at
Stanley’s wound. A bullet had plowed a furrow
through the back of his leg just below his knee,
and although the artery had not been cut and the
bone was uninjured, everybody saw at a glance
that it was impossible for him to go any farther.
Hopkins inquired where he could find a surgeon,
but the negro wouldn’t tell him, declaring that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
he set out in search of one he would never see his
friends again.</p>

<p>While Hopkins was trying to make up his mind
what he ought to do, he suddenly became aware
that there was something the matter with himself.
One of his boots seemed to be growing tighter,
and he limped painfully when he tried to walk
across the floor.</p>

<p>“I declare, I believe I have sprained my ankle,”
said he; and an examination proved that he had.
His ankle was badly swollen and inflamed, and
after he took his boot off he could not bear the
weight of his foot upon the floor.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’ns has got to put up at my hotel
dis night, bofe of you,” said Robinson. “You
can’t go no furder, dat’s sho’.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better let us lie out in the
woods,” said Hopkins. “If the strikers should
return and find us here, they might do you some
injury.”</p>

<p>The negro said he didn’t care for that. Soldiers
had more than once put themselves in danger for
him, and it was a pity if he couldn’t do something
for them. At any rate he would take the risk.
He bustled about at a lively rate while he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
talking, and in five minutes more the disabled
boys had been carried up the ladder that led to
the loft and stored away there on some hay that
had been provided for them. After that Stanley’s
leg was dressed with cold coffee, which Robinson
declared to be the best thing in the world for gunshot
wounds. Hopkins’s ankle was bound up in
cloths wet with hot water, a plain but bountiful
supper was served up to them, and they were left
to their meditations. Of course they did not sleep
much, for they couldn’t. They suffered a good
deal of pain, but not a word of complaint was
heard from either of them. Hopkins acted as
nurse during the night, and shortly after daylight
sunk into an uneasy slumber, from which he was
aroused by a gentle push from Stanley, who shook
his finger at him to keep him quiet.</p>

<p>“They’ve come,” whispered his companion.</p>

<p>“They! Who?” said Hopkins, starting up.</p>

<p>“The mob. Don’t you hear them?”</p>

<p>Hopkins listened, and his hair seemed to rise on
end when he caught the low hum of conversation
outside, which grew louder and more distinct as a
party of men approached the house. Enjoining
silence upon his companion Hopkins drew himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
slowly and painfully over the hay to the end of
the loft, and looked out of a convenient knot hole.
Stanley, who watched all his movements with the
keenest interest, trembled all over when Hopkins
held up all his fingers to indicate that there were
ten of them. He also made other motions signifying
that the rioters were armed and that they
had brought ropes with them. Just then there
was a movement in the room below, and Robinson
opened the door and stepped out to wait the mob.</p>

<p>“Say, nigger,” exclaimed one of the leaders,
“where are those boys who were here last night?”</p>

<p>Robinson replied that he didn’t know where
they were. They had been taken to the city early
that morning, and he thought they were in the
hospital.</p>

<p>“Were they both hurt?” asked one of the
rioters.</p>

<p>“Yes; one had a bullet through his leg, and the
other had been shot in the foot.”</p>

<p>“We wish those bullets had been through their
heads,” said the leader. “It’s well for them that
they got away, for we came here on purpose to
hang them.”</p>

<p>“Dat would serve ’em just right,” said Robinson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
“Dey ain’t got no call to come down hyar
an’ go to foolin’ wid de workin’ man when he
wants his bread an’ butter. No, sar, dey ain’t.”</p>

<p>The boys in the loft awaited the result of this
conference with fear and trembling. They fully
expected that the rioters would search the house
and drag them from their place of concealment,
but the negro answered all their questions so
readily and appeared to be so frank and truthful,
that their suspicions were not aroused. When
Stanley, who kept a close watch of his friend, saw
him kiss his hand toward the knot-hole, he drew
a long breath of relief, for he knew that the rioters
were going away.</p>

<p>This visit satisfied both them and their sable
host that they were not safe there, and Robinson
at once sent his oldest boy to the nearest farm-house
to borrow a horse and wagon. When the
vehicle arrived the boys were put into it, and
Robinson took the reins and drove away with all
the speed he could induce the horse to put forth.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose those men knew that we
were at your house?” said Hopkins.</p>

<p>“One of dem no account niggers dat was dar
las’ night done went an’ tol’ ’em,” replied Robinson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
angrily. “I’ll jest keep my eye peeled fur
dat feller, an’ when I find him, I’ll make him
think he’s done been struck by lightnin’. I will
so.”</p>

<p>Robinson took the boys to the house of the
nearest surgeon, who received and treated them
with the greatest kindness and hospitality. As
Hopkins and Stanley were boys who never spent
their money foolishly they always had plenty of it,
and consequently they were able to bestow a liberal
reward upon the negro, who volunteered to
drive to the nearest station and sent off a despatch
for them. The next day a carriage arrived from
Bridgeport and Hopkins went home in it, but
Stanley, much to his regret, was ordered to remain
behind, the surgeon refusing to consent to his removal;
but he could not have been in pleasanter
quarters or under better care.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen other boys in the room
who told stories of escapes that were fully as interesting
as this one. They could have talked all
night, but the supper-call sounded, and that broke
up the meeting.</p>

<span class="smaller">PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS.</span></h2>

<p>“I say, fellows,” exclaimed Egan, the next
time he found all his friends together,
“there’s something going to happen during this
camp that never happened before. The paymaster
is coming here to settle with us.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I mean that we are entitled to a dollar a day
for the work our company did at Hamilton,”
replied Egan. “As we were under orders five days
we have five dollars apiece coming to us from the
State.”</p>

<p>“Do the wounded come in for that much?”
inquired Hopkins.</p>

<p>“They belong to the company, do they not?”
demanded Egan. “They are not to blame for
getting hurt, are they? They will get just as
much as the others.”</p>

<p>We may here remark that the Legislature gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
them more. Hopkins received a hundred dollars
to pay him for his sprained ankle; the boy who
was hit in the eye with a buck-shot, and who stood
a fair chance of going blind from the effects of it,
got eleven hundred; Stanley received six hundred,
and so did each of the boys who were shot at Don
Gordon’s side when the company was ordered out
of the car.</p>

<p>“I’ll never spend those five dollars,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Neither will I,” chimed in Hopkins. “If I
get the money all in one bill, I’ll have it framed
and hang it up in my room beside a fox-brush
which I won at the risk of my neck.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how mine would look hung around
the neck of that white swan that led me such a
race two winters ago,” said Egan. “I think they
will go well together, and every time I look at
them, they will remind me of the most exciting
incident of my life. Gordon, you’ll have to make
yours into a rug and spread it on the floor beside
the skin of that bear that came so near making an
end of Lester Brigham.”</p>

<p>The boys had only three days more to devote to
study during the school term, and much lost time
to make up. The work was hard, they found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
almost impossible to keep their minds upon their
books, and everybody, teachers as well as students,
was glad when the first day of August arrived,
and the battalion took up its line of march for its
old camping ground. The students were hardly
allowed time to become settled in their new quarters
before their friends began to flock into the
camp. A few fathers and guardians came there
with the intention of taking their sons and wards
from the school at once—they did not want them
to remain if they were expected to risk their lives
in fighting rioters. Some of the timid ones were
glad to go; but the others, who were full of military
ardor, begged hard to be permitted to complete
the course, and pleaded their cause with so
much ability that their fathers relented, and even
took the trouble to hunt up Professor Kellogg and
congratulate him on having “broken the back-bone”
of the Hamilton riot.</p>

<p>Lester Brigham’s father and mother were among
the visitors, and so were General Gordon and his
wife. The former were very indignant when they
left Rochdale. Mr. Brigham repeatedly declaring
that it was a sin and an outrage for the superintendent
to send boys like those under his care into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
battle, and after he had told him, in plain language,
what he thought of such a proceeding, he
was going to take Lester out of that school without
any delay or ceremony. But when he reached
the camp, he did not feel that way. General Gordon
reasoned with him, and when he shook hands
with Lester, he said he was sorry the boy hadn’t
been in the fight, so that he could praise him for
his gallant conduct. Mr. Brigham didn’t know
that Lester had hidden his head under the bed-clothes
when the bugle sounded.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you would want me to leave the
school,” faltered Lester, as soon as he had somewhat
recovered from his surprise.</p>

<p>“By no means,” said his father, earnestly.
“You boys will have full control of this government
some day—did you ever think of that?—and
now is the time for you to learn your duty as
citizens. What are you going to be when this
examination comes off? A captain, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t be anything,” replied Lester, who
could scarcely conceal his rage. “I shall never be
an officer, because I can’t see the beauty of toadying
to the teachers. I’ll not stay here to fight
strikers, either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“I sincerely hope your company will never be
called upon to perform any duty so hazardous,”
said Mr. Brigham; “but if it is, I want to hear
that you are in the front rank. If you do not obtain
promotion this examination, I shall think you
have wasted your time.”</p>

<p>“I have invited a couple of my friends to go
home with me,” said Lester, who wanted to make
sure of a cordial reception for Jones and Williams,
even if he and they were expelled from the academy
for misconduct.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it,” said Mr. Brigham.
“Your mother and I will endeavor to make their
visit so agreeable that they will want to come
again.”</p>

<p>“And Williams has invited me to go home with
him next year,” added Lester. “He lives down in
Maryland, a short distance from Egan and Hopkins.
May I go?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Make all the friends you can, but
be sure that they are the right sort.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got his promise,” said Lester to himself,
as he paced his lonely beat that night, “and he’ll
not break it. But I must say he’s a nice father
for any fellow to have. I thought sure he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
come here to take me home with him. He talks
very glibly about my risking life and limb in defence
of law and order, but would he take it so
easy if he were in my place? I’ll not stay here
another year, and that’s flat.”</p>

<p>Contrary to his expectations Lester Brigham,
although he fell far behind his class in both
deportment and studies, had not been left at the
academy under arrest, and now he was glad of it.
It was easier to get out of the camp than it was
to leave the academy grounds, and he and his fellow-conspirators
could hold a consultation every
day. They began to exhibit some activity now,
and among those who had agreed to accompany
Lester on his “picnic” there was not one who
showed any signs of backing out, or who even
thought of it, with the exception of Lester himself.
Three of their number had been taken
home by their angry parents, but those who
remained held to their purpose, and urged their
leaders to decide upon a plan of operations.
Lester, who had been rendered almost desperate
by the extraordinary behavior of his father, was
anxious that something should be done at once,
and he and his two right-hand men had many an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
earnest conference, the result of which was the
promulgation of an order to the effect that none
of the “band,” as they called themselves, should
ask for a pass until they were told to do so.</p>

<p>“That will keep us together, you know,” said
Lester and his lieutenants. “If one of us asks
for a pass to-day and another to-morrow—why,
when the time for action comes those who have already
been out will be refused, and consequently
not more than half of us will get away. Williams
will have to go out to do a little scouting so as to
ascertain when and where we can get a boat, but
the rest of us must be content to stay in.”</p>

<p>Their first week under canvas was a busy one,
as it always was. The fortifications, which had
been thrown up the year before in anticipation of
that fight with the Mount Pleasant Indians, must
be repaired and camp routine established before
liberty was granted to anybody. Before this
work was completed many of their visitors took
their departure. Among these were General and
Mrs. Gordon, who wished Don and Bert a pleasant
visit with their friend Curtis in his northern home,
and Lester’s father and mother, who did not
forget to give the boy a good supply of spending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
money before they went, and to assure Jones and
Williams that they looked forward to their visit to
Rochdale with many pleasurable anticipations.</p>

<p>“That money is intended for the use of yourself
and your friends,” said Mr. Brigham. “If it is
stolen from you, or if the superintendent finds out
that I gave it to you, it will be your own fault.
If you will come home with a strap on your shoulder,
I will give you as much more.”</p>

<p>During the second week passes were freely
granted, and one of the first to go out was Enoch
Williams, whose duty it was to find a suitable
boat and lay plans for seizing it at a specified
time. He was gone all day, and when he came
back he was full of enthusiasm, some of which he
communicated to Jones, who was the first boy he
met after reporting his return. They exchanged
a few whispered words, and then hurried off to
find Lester.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Brigham,” said Jones, gleefully.
“Enoch has done his full duty, and deserves the
thanks of every fellow in the band. We’re off to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p>Somehow Lester did not feel as highly elated
over this piece of news as his friends thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
would. He wanted to desert and do something
that would make the academy boys talk about him
after he was gone, but he wished from the bottom
of his heart that he had never said a word about
running away in a boat.</p>

<p>“I think myself that I have planned things
better than any other boy in the band could have
done it,” said Enoch, with no little satisfaction in
his tones. “I’ve got the boat, and now you must
assess every fellow in the band five dollars.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Lester.</p>

<p>“To pay for her, and to buy our provisions.”</p>

<p>“To pay for her,” echoed Lester. “I thought
we were going to steal her.”</p>

<p>“So we are—after a while. Now I will begin
at the beginning and tell you just what I have
done: When I got down to the river I found that
the cutter I wanted to take on account of her superior
accommodations, had gone off on a cruise,
and that there was only one yacht in port. But
she’s a beauty, and I wouldn’t be afraid to go to
Europe in her. She was anchored out in the
stream, and while I was wondering how I could
get aboard of her, her keeper came off in a dory
and told me that if I wanted to take a look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
schooner he would be glad of my company, for he
was alone there. I went, and in less than an hour
I had everything arranged. His owner is going
on a cruise with a party of friends next Monday,
and it took but little urging on my part to induce
the keeper to agree to give the band a ride down
the river to-morrow night, provided we would
promise to come back when he said the word, so
that he could have the schooner in her berth at
daylight.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t promise that, of course,” said
Lester, when Enoch paused to take breath.</p>

<p>“Of course I did,” answered Enoch.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a good one,” exclaimed Lester,
in deep disgust. “I’ll not go on any such expedition.
A night ride on the river! There would
be lots of fun in that, wouldn’t there? When I
start on this picnic I don’t intend to come back to
Bridgeport until I have had sport enough to pay
me for the trouble of deserting, or I am captured
and brought back.”</p>

<p>“Neither do we,” said Jones, as soon as he saw a
chance to crowd a word in edgewise. “Let Enoch
finish his story, and then see if you don’t think
more of his plans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“I promised that he could come back with his
vessel before daylight, so that his owner wouldn’t
suspect that he had been doing a little cruising on
his own hook,” continued Enoch, “but I didn’t
say that we would come back with him.”</p>

<p>“You might as well have said so,” snapped
Lester. “Where are we going to stay and what
are we going to do without a boat to sail about
in?”</p>

<p>“Wait until I have had my say, and then you
may talk yourself blind for all I care,” retorted
Enoch, who was beginning to get angry.</p>

<p>“Go easy, Williams,” Jones interposed. “We
don’t want a row before we get out of camp. If
we go to quarreling among ourselves there’s an
end of all our fun.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to quarrel,” said Lester, who did
not like the way Enoch glared at him.</p>

<p>“Then wait till I get through before you pass
judgment upon the arrangements I have made,”
exclaimed Enoch. “I didn’t promise Coleman—that’s
the boat-keeper’s name—that we would return
to Bridgeport with him, and neither did I
say that he could bring the yacht back, for I don’t
intend that he shall do anything of the kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“How are you going to prevent it?” inquired
Lester.</p>

<p>“That’s the best part of the plan,” said Jones.
“Go on, Enoch.”</p>

<p>“This is the way we will prevent it,” continued
the latter. “We’ll go with him as far as Windsor,
and then we will stop and make an excuse to
get him ashore. As soon as we are rid of him
we’ll fill away for the bay. If the wind is at all
brisk he can’t catch us.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to that?” demanded
Jones.</p>

<p>“I say it looks like business,” answered Lester,
who now, for the first time, began to take some
interest in his scheme. “It’s all right, Enoch;
you couldn’t have done better, and I couldn’t have
done as well. There’s my hand.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would like it after you had
given me a chance to explain,” said Enoch, growing
good-natured again.</p>

<p>“So did I,” chimed in Jones. “We want to
do something daring and reckless, you know;
something that will make the good little boys open
their eyes.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one objection to it,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Enoch. “When we send Coleman ashore we shall
lose our small boat, but we can easily stop at one
of the islands in the bay and borrow another.”</p>

<p>“So we can,” exclaimed Lester, with great enthusiasm.
“Say, boys, what’s the use of buying
any provisions? Let’s turn pirates and forage on
the farmers for our grub?”</p>

<p>“That’s the very idea,” said Enoch.</p>

<p>“I am in favor of foraging and have been all
the while,” said Jones. “But we must be careful
and not try to carry things with too high a hand.
If we get the farmers down on us, they will help
our pursuers all they can, and that will bring our
cruise to an end very speedily. We must buy the
most of our provisions and we must speak to the
boys about it now, so that when they ask for a
pass they can draw on the superintendent for five
dollars apiece.”</p>

<p>“But how will you get out of the lines,
Enoch?” inquired Lester. “The superintendent
will not grant you liberty for two days in succession.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get out; don’t you worry about that,”
replied Enoch, confidently. “Now let’s separate
and post the other boys, and see who they want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
for treasurer. That’s an official we have never
had any use for before.”</p>

<p>“Tell them that I am a candidate,” said Lester,
who thought he would be a little better satisfied
if he could keep his five dollars in his own hands.</p>

<p>“That won’t do at all,” said Jones, quickly.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” chimed in Enoch. “You’ll
have enough to do to manage the yacht. I shall
push Jones for the office.”</p>

<p>“By the way, how much did you agree to pay
Coleman for giving us a ride down the river?”
asked Lester.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five dollars,” replied Enoch.</p>

<p>“That’s a good deal of money to pay out for
nothing. The understanding was that we were to
capture our vessel. If we had held to that, we
could have got her for nothing.”</p>

<p>“And had a tug after us as soon as she could
get up steam,” replied Enoch. “As I said before,
this schooner is the only yacht in port. We
couldn’t capture her without getting into a fight
with Coleman, and if we had alarmed anybody, we
should have had to run a race with the telegraph
as well as with the tug. Now, remember what I
say, Lester: We shall be in danger as long as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
are this side of Oxford. Coleman knows that we
are going to take French leave, and has promised
to be as sly as he can in taking us on board the
schooner; but no matter how carefully we cover
up our trail, some sharp fellow like Mack will be
sure to find it, and telegraph the authorities at
Oxford to be on the look-out for us.”</p>

<p>“And Coleman himself will raise an outcry just
as soon as he finds out that we have given him the
slip,” added Jones.</p>

<p>“To be sure he will. I tell you, Brigham, we’re
going to have a time of it, and you will have a
chance to show just how smart you are. After we
get the schooner everything will depend upon you.
If you can take us safely past Oxford and out into
the bay, you will be a leader worth having, and the
boys will feel so much confidence in you that they
will do anything you say.”</p>

<p>“And if I fail in my efforts to do that, they
will lose what little confidence they have in me
now, and put somebody else in my place,” said
Lester to himself, as he and his friends moved off
in different directions to hunt up the rest of the
band and tell them of the plans that had been determined
upon. “What am I to do now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a time when Don Gordon would
have been delighted with such a prospect as this.
The responsibility resting upon the captain of the
schooner, and which was much too heavy a burden
for Lester to bear, would have aroused all the
combativeness in his nature, and made him determined
to succeed in spite of every obstacle that
could be thrown in his way. Lester, however, felt
like backing out, and he would have done so if
he had received the least encouragement from a
single one of the band to whom he spoke that
night. They were all strongly in favor of Enoch’s
plan, and promised to be on hand at the appointed
time with their money in their pockets.</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to go, now is the time to
say so,” Lester ventured to suggest, hoping that
some timid boy would take the hint and give him
an excuse for staying behind himself; but the invariable
reply was:</p>

<p>“I do want to go. I didn’t agree to this thing
just to hear myself talk. If you fellows are going,
I am going too.”</p>

<p>“Whom have you seen, Brigham?” asked
Jones, as the two met again just before the supper
call was sounded. “All right. Enoch and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
seen the rest, and have found them all true blue.
There’s not a single weak-kneed one among them.
We mustn’t leave the camp in a body, you know,
for that might excite suspicion; but we’ll see
them in Bridgeport to-morrow afternoon, and tell
them to be at Haggert’s dock at dark.”</p>

<p>They were all going, that was evident, and Lester
did not see how he could refuse to accompany
them. If he feigned illness or neglected to ask for
a pass, he would surely be found out and accused
of cowardice, and then the boys would have nothing
more to do with him. There were few outside
the band who ever took the trouble to speak to
him, and if they deserted him he would be lonely
indeed.</p>

<p>“And more than all, Williams and Jones would
refuse to go home with me, and that would knock
my visit to Maryland in the head,” said Lester to
himself. “That wouldn’t be at all pleasant. I
shall have a harder time at Rochdale than I ever
had before. Don and Bert Gordon will be sure to
tell all the people there how I have acted ever
since I came to the academy, and what a coward
I was on the night the false alarm was given, and
they will make it so disagreeable for me that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
can’t stay. I must stick to those boys, for they
are the only friends I have. I believe I’ll turn
the command of the yacht over to Enoch. He
wants it and I don’t; and if I give it up to him
of my own free will, perhaps it will increase his
friendship for me.”</p>

<p>Lester breathed easier after he made this resolution,
and, although he did not enjoy his sleep
that night, he did not look forward with so many
gloomy forebodings. He received his pass and his
money when he asked for them, and in company
with Jones set out for Bridgeport. They directed
their course toward Haggert’s dock, and when
they reached it Lester obtained his first view of a
sea-going yacht. One glance at her was enough
to satisfy him that he could do nothing with her,
and he suddenly thought of an excuse for saying
so.</p>

<p>“Is that the schooner?” he asked, as he and
his companion seated themselves on a spar that
was lying on the dock.</p>

<p>“Why, of course she’s a schooner,” exclaimed
Jones, looking up in surprise. “A vessel of that
size wouldn’t be square-rigged, would she? Can’t
you see that she is a fore-and-after?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not being blind I can,” replied Lester, loftily.
“I inquired if she was <i>the</i> schooner—the one we
are going to take.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” replied Jones. “Yes, I suppose she is,
but I can very soon find out,” he added, as he
drew his handkerchief from his pocket. “If that
man who is lounging in the cockpit is Coleman, I
can bring him ashore.”</p>

<p>“Having always been used to plenty of sea-room,
I am not sure that I can handle the schooner
in this narrow river,” said Lester.</p>

<p>“We are not going to stay in the river, you
know,” answered Jones. “We shall get out of it
as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>“I know that; but Enoch said last night that
we shall be in danger as long as we remain this
side of Oxford, and the boy who takes us down
the river ought to be one who knows how to handle
boats in close places. I don’t know much
about schooners, for, as I told you long ago, my
yacht was a cutter.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference?” asked Jones.</p>

<p>“There is a good deal of difference the first
thing you know,” exclaimed Lester; and fearing
that he might be asked to tell what it was, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
hastened to say: “Williams is a good fellow and
a good sailor too, if I am any judge, and I think I
will ask him to take command. Of course I could
manage the schooner, and perhaps I will take her
in hand after Enoch gets her out of the river.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jones. “I guess Enoch will
take her if you ask him. That’s Coleman.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because he waved his hand in reply to my
signal, and is now coming off in his boat.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Coleman rowed up to the
wharf in his dory. He did not get out, but stood
up in his boat and kept it in its place by holding
fast to a ring-bolt.</p>

<p>“I wanted to make sure that everything is just
as it should be,” said Jones, who saw that the
boat-keeper was waiting to hear what he had to
say. “Can we go on our cruise to-night?”</p>

<p>“Are you one of the deserters?” asked Coleman.</p>

<p>“I am; and my friend here, is another. One
of our fellows was down here yesterday and talked
the matter over with you. Has anything occurred
to interfere with the arrangements you and he
made?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not that I know of. How many of you are
there?”</p>

<p>“Just twenty-five,” replied Jones.</p>

<p>“That will be a dollar a piece,” said Coleman.
“Can you raise so much money? Then it’s all
right; but there’s one thing I want understood before
we start: I must be back here before daylight.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to prevent it,” answered
Jones; “that is, if you can walk back from Windsor
by that time,” he added, mentally.</p>

<p>“I am doing this thing without my owner’s
knowledge,” continued Coleman. “If he should
come down here early in the morning and find the
yacht gone, I’d lose my situation.”</p>

<p>“We know that. All we ask of you is to take
us as far as Windsor, where we intend to go
ashore for an hour or two. You don’t object to
that, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. If you don’t want to go any farther
than that, I can easily get back in time to avoid
suspicion. Anything going on at Windsor?”</p>

<p>“A party,” replied Jones.</p>

<p>After a little more conversation the two boys
got up and walked away, and Coleman went back
to the schooner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is that much done,” said Jones. “We
have paved the way for getting him ashore. After
we get him up in town we will lose him, and then
we’ll have the schooner to ourselves. Now let’s
separate and look out for the rest of the fellows.
Tell them about the party that isn’t going to
come off in Windsor, and give them to understand
that they may talk about it as much as they please
in Coleman’s hearing. Urge upon them the necessity
of being on the dock at dusk, so as not to run
the risk of being left behind, but caution them
against forming a crowd there. We don’t want
anybody to see us off, and consequently we must
be careful not to attract attention. Williams and
I will meet you at noon at Cony Ryan’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t bring any other fellows with you,”
said Lester, who knew that this meant pies, pancakes
and milk for three, and that he would have
to foot the bill.</p>

<p>Jones said he wouldn’t, and the two boys gave
each other a farewell salute, and set out in different
directions in search of the other members of
the band.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DESERTERS AFLOAT.</span></h2>

<p>If the deserters had had the ordering of things
themselves they could not have made them
work more to their satisfaction. There was not a
single hitch anywhere; but there was just enough
excitement to put them on their mettle, and give
them an idea of what was before them. In less
than twenty minutes after Lester Brigham parted
from his friend Jones, he ran against Captain
Mack and Don Gordon. The latter wore a bayonet
by his side to show that he was on duty. If
they had not been so close to him, Lester would
have taken to his heels. Although he had not yet
deserted, and carried a paper in his pocket that
would protect him, the sight of these two boys
made him feel guilty and anxious.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Brigham,” exclaimed the young captain,
as he returned Lester’s salute. “If I didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
know better, I should say that you were out on
French leave.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not,” answered Lester, with more
earnestness than the circumstances seemed to warrant.
“I have a pass.”</p>

<p>“I know it, for I was in the superintendent’s
marquee when it was given to you,” said the captain.
“But I must say that you look rather
queer for an innocent boy. Seen anything of
Enoch Williams?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” replied Lester, who now began
to prick up his ears. “Is he out?”</p>

<p>The captain laughed and said he was.</p>

<p>“Has he got a pass?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. If he had we wouldn’t be
looking for him, would we? He followed Egan’s
example and Gordon’s, and ran the guard in broad
daylight. We’ve traced him to the village, and
we’re going to catch him if we have to stay here
for a week. The boy who was on post at the time
Enoch went out said he ran like the wind, and if I
can get Don after him, I expect to see a race
worth looking at. My men are scattered all over
the village, and if you see Enoch I wish you would
post some of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will,” answered Lester.</p>

<p>“He won’t,” said Don, as he and the captain
moved on.</p>

<p>“I know that very well,” returned Mack.
“Brigham is up to something himself, or else his
face belies him.”</p>

<p>“He and Jones and Williams are cronies, you
know,” continued Don, “and I believe that the
surest way to find our man is to keep an eye on
Lester.”</p>

<p>“I believe so myself,” said the captain, giving
his companion a hearty slap on the back.
“That’s a bright idea, Gordon, and we’ll act
on it.”</p>

<p>“Mack thinks he’s smart, but he may find out
that there are some boys in the world who are
quite as smart as he is,” soliloquized Lester, as he
moved on up the street. “I don’t know whether
I want Enoch to command that schooner after all.
His running the guard in daylight shows that he
is inclined to take too many risks.”</p>

<p>Lester began to be alarmed now; the village
seemed to be full of Captain Mack’s men. He
met them at nearly every corner, and they, as in
duty bound, asked to see his pass, and made inquiries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
concerning the deserter. Every one of them
declared that there was something afoot.</p>

<p>“Williams didn’t run the guard in that daring
way and come to town for nothing,” said they.
“There’s no circus here, nor is there anything interesting
going on that we can hear of; but
there’s a scheme of some kind in the wind, and we
know it.”</p>

<p>Lester’s fears increased every time Captain
Mack’s men talked to him in this way, and he
began looking about for Jones. He wanted to
know what the latter thought about it; but he
could not find him, nor could he see any of the
band. They had all disappeared very suddenly
and mysteriously, and now the only academy boys
he met were those who wore bayonets. Eleven
o’clock came at last, and Lester was on the point
of starting for Cony Ryan’s, when he heard his
name pronounced in low and guarded tones, and
looked quickly around to see Jones standing in a
dark doorway.</p>

<p>“Don’t come in here,” whispered the latter, as
Lester stepped toward the door. “Stand in front
of that window and pretend to be looking at the
pictures, and then I’ll talk to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Lester wonderingly obeyed, and Jones continued:</p>

<p>“We’re suspected already.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” answered Lester, in the same cautious
whisper. “Mack’s men all believe that
Enoch had some object in deserting as he did, and
one of them said they wouldn’t go home until
they caught him if they had to stay here a week.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what they said to me,” returned
Jones. “The thing is getting interesting already,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Almost too much so. What do you suppose
the teachers would do to us if Mack should hear
of our plans?”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t do anything but stop our
liberty,” replied Jones. “Some of the best fellows
in the school make it a point to desert every camp,
and there’s nothing done to them. Stealing the
schooner is what is going to do the business for us.
We’ll be sent down for that, and it’s just what we
want.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of Enoch?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s all right. He’s gone down to
Ryan’s to order dinner for us.”</p>

<p>“Where are the rest of the fellows?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some of them are hiding about the village,
and the others have gone down to Ryan’s. Enoch
and I thought it best to tell them, one and all, to
keep out of sight. If Mack and his men should
hear of our plan, the fat would all be in the fire.”</p>

<p>“Would they arrest us?”</p>

<p>“You’re right.”</p>

<p>“Why, we haven’t done anything.”</p>

<p>“No, but we’re going to do something, and if
they knew it, it would be their duty to stop us.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you come out, or why can’t
I go in there?” demanded Lester. “There’s no
one, except village people, in sight.”</p>

<p>“There’s where you are mistaken,” replied Jones.
“Look across the street. Do you see that fellow on
the opposite sidewalk who appears to be so deeply
interested in something he sees in the window of
that dry-goods store?”</p>

<p>Yes, Lester saw him. He had seen him before,
and took him for just what he appeared to be—a
country boy out for a holiday. His tight black
trowsers would not come more than half-way down
the legs of his big cowhide boots; his felt hat was
perched on the top of a thick shock of hair which
looked like a small brush-heap; his short coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
sleeves revealed wrists and arms that were as
brown as sole-leather; and the coarse red handkerchief
which was tied around his face seemed to
indicate that he was suffering from the toothache.
But if he was, it did not prevent him from
thoroughly enjoying his lunch—a cake of ginger-bread
and an apple which he had purchased at a
neighboring stand, and which he devoured with
so much eagerness, as he stood there in front of
the window, that everybody who saw him laughed
at him.</p>

<p>“I see some gawky over there,” said Lester,
after he had taken a glance at the boy.</p>

<p>“That’s no gawky,” replied Jones. “It’s Don
Gordon.”</p>

<p>Lester was profoundly astonished. He faced
about and looked again. There was nothing about
that awkward clown, who did not know what to
do with his big feet, that looked like the neat and
graceful Don Gordon he had met a short time
before.</p>

<p>“You’re certainly mistaken,” said Lester.
“Don’s pride wouldn’t let him appear in the
public street in any such rig as that.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t, eh? You don’t know that boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides, Gordon couldn’t look and act so
clumsy if he tried,” continued Lester, who had
striven in vain to imitate Don’s soldierly carriage.
“Why, he is making a laughing-stock of himself.”</p>

<p>“I know it, and so does he; and he enjoys it.
I don’t know where he procured his disguise, but
if he didn’t borrow it, he bought it. He’s got
more money than he can spend, and he will stick
at nothing that will help him gain his point. Now,
can you see Mack anywhere?”</p>

<p>Lester looked up and down the street and
replied that he could not.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s somewhere around, and you may
be sure of it,” Jones went on. “He is keeping
Don in sight, and Don has disguised himself so
that he can keep <i>you</i> in sight. They have been
following you around the streets for two hours,
and this is the first chance I have had to tell you
of it. Have you let anything slip?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Lester, indignantly.</p>

<p>“You’re spotted, any way; and I can’t, for the
life of me, see why you should be if you have
kept a still tongue in your head,” said Jones, in
deep perplexity. “Now, our first hard work must
be to shake those fellows, and then we’ll draw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
bee-line for Cony’s. When I say the word, come
into the hall and go up those stairs as if all the
wolves in Mississippi were close at your heels; but
don’t make any noise.”</p>

<p>Lester braced himself for a jump and a run,
and Jones took up a position in the hall from
which he could observe Don’s movements without
being seen himself. The amateur detective—it
really was Don Gordon—having disposed of his
lunch and growing tired of waiting for Lester to
make a move in some direction, shuffled rather than
walked over to the other window, not neglecting,
as he made this change, to take a good look at the
boy he had “spotted.” As soon as he was fairly
settled before the other window, Jones whispered
“<i>Now!</i>” whereupon Lester darted through the
door and went up the stairs three at a jump.
Jones lingered a minute or two and then followed
him.</p>

<p>“It’s just as I expected,” said he, hurriedly,
when he joined Lester at the top of the stairs.
“Captain Mack was concealed somewhere down
the street. He saw you when you ran through
the door and signaled to Don, who is now
coming across the street. Follow me and run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
on your toes. Stick to me, and ask no questions.”</p>

<p>So saying Jones broke into a run and led the
way through a long hall to another flight of stairs,
which he descended with headlong speed, Lester
keeping close at his heels. On reaching the sidewalk
they slackened their pace to a walk, and
Jones suddenly turned into a shoe-store, with the
proprietor of which he was well acquainted.</p>

<p>“Mr. Smith,” said he, addressing the man who
stood behind the counter, “may I go in your back
room long enough to take something out of my
boot?”</p>

<p>Time was too precious to wait for the reply,
which they knew would be a favorable one, so
Jones and Lester kept on to the back-room.
When they got there the former took his foot out
of his boot—there was nothing else in it—while
his companion, acting in obedience to some whispered
instructions, concealed himself and kept an
eye on those who passed the store.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” he exclaimed suddenly, as
Don Gordon walked rapidly by, peering sharply
through the glass doors as he went. “He must
have followed us through the hall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course he did, and consequently there is no
need that I should tell you why I came in here.
Now we’ll start for Cony’s.”</p>

<p>As Jones said this he opened a back door which
gave entrance into a narrow alley, and conducted his
companion through a long archway that finally
brought them to a cross-street. After making
sure that there were none of Captain Mack’s men
in sight, they came out of their concealment and
walked rapidly away toward the big pond. When
they reached Cony Ryan’s house and entered the
little parlor which had been the scene of so many
midnight revels, they found it in possession of
their friends, who greeted them in the most boisterous
manner and inquired anxiously for Enoch
Williams. A few of them had had opportunity to
exchange a word or two with him, all knew how
he had run the guard, but none of them could
tell where he was now.</p>

<p>“He is safe enough,” said Jones, knowingly.
“Of course you don’t expect him to show himself
openly, as we can who have passes in our
pockets. If you will be on Haggert’s dock at
dark—and those who are not there will stand a
good chance of being left, for when we get ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to start we shall wait for nobody—you will find
him. In the meantime be careful how you act,
and keep out of sight as much as you can. Mack
knows that we haven’t come down here for
nothing.”</p>

<p>The boys said they were well aware of that fact,
and Jones went on to tell how closely Don Gordon
and Captain Mack had watched Lester in the
hope of finding out what it was that had brought
him and his friends to town that day, and described
how he and Lester had managed to elude
them. While the boys were laughing over the
success of their stratagem, Jones disappeared
through a back door, but presently returned and
beckoned to Lester, who followed him into the
kitchen. Cony Ryan was there, and he had just
placed upon the table two large buckets covered
with snow-white napkins.</p>

<p>“That’s your dinner,” said he, as he shook
hands with Lester, who had put many a dollar
into his pocket that term. “They tell me that
you are getting to be a very bad boy, Brigham.
You have put the fellows up to stealing a yacht.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty good scheme, isn’t it?” said
Jones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never heard of such a thing,” said Cony.
“I know every boy who has been graduated at
this academy during the last half century, and
although there were some daring ones among
them, there were none who had the hardihood to
do a thing like this. I have about half made up
my mind that if Captain Mack comes here, I will
report the last one of you.”</p>

<p>“Well, so long as you don’t wholly make up
your mind to it, we don’t care,” replied Jones,
who knew their host too well to be alarmed by
any such threats as this. “I’ll take one basket,
Brigham, and you can take the other. Cony, you
keep your eyes open and give us the signal at the
very first sign of danger.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” inquired Lester, as
Jones, with one of the baskets on his arm, led the
way out of the door toward a grove that stood a
little distance off on the shore of the big pond.</p>

<p>“To find Enoch,” answered Jones. “I know
right where he is. I say, Lester, you did something
to be proud of when you got up this scheme.
When Cony Ryan praises a fellow, the praise is
well deserved.”</p>

<p>“I am very well satisfied with it,” said Lester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
complacently. “You said something about a signal
of danger; what is it?”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear Cony’s greyhound sing?”
asked Jones in reply. “Well, if Cony sees any of
Mack’s men approaching his house, he’ll tell his
hound to ‘sing,’ and the animal will set up the
most dismal howling you ever heard. If Enoch
hears that, you will see him dig out for dear life.”</p>

<p>After walking a short distance into the grove,
the two boys came to a little creek, whose banks
were thickly lined with bushes. Here Jones stopped
and put down his basket, and hardly had he
done so when Enoch Williams made his appearance.
He had been concealed in the bushes,
awaiting their arrival. This was the first time
Lester had seen the deserter that day, and one
would have thought by the way he complimented
Enoch, that the latter, when he ran by the guard,
had performed an exploit that no other boy in
the academy dare attempt.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you two,” said Enoch, nodding
his head toward the baskets, “for I am
hungry.”</p>

<p>“Any news?” asked Jones, as he spread the lunch
on one of the napkins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a word,” replied the deserter. “I
haven’t seen Mack or any of his squad for a long
time.”</p>

<p>“We have,” said Lester. “We’ve just had
some fun in getting away from them.”</p>

<p>Of course Enoch wanted to know all about it,
and Jones told the story while they were eating
their lunch. The good things that Cony had put
up for them rapidly disappeared before their attacks,
but busy as they were, they did not neglect
to keep their eyes and ears open. They depended
upon Cony and his hound to guard one side of the
grove, and upon themselves to detect the presence
of any danger that might threaten them from
other directions; but Mack and his men never
came near them. Being well acquainted with
Cony Ryan, they knew it would be a waste of
time to look for a deserter about his premises.
The old fellow was a staunch and trustworthy
friend. He could not be bribed, coaxed or flattered
into betraying a boy’s confidence.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the day never would draw to a
close. As Enoch did not think it safe to venture
near the house, Jones and Lester kept him company
in the grove, where they rolled about on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
grass, consulting their watches every few minutes
and laying out a programme for their cruise. By
this time it was understood that Enoch was to
command the schooner. He was delighted when
Lester proposed it, accepted the responsibility
without the least hesitation, and spoke confidently
of his ability to make the cruise a lively one and
to give their pursuers a long chase, if he could
only succeed in getting the yacht out into the
bay.</p>

<p>The hours wore away, and when six o’clock
came the deserter and his friends finished what
was left of their lunch and began to bestir themselves.
Jones and Lester returned to Cony Ryan’s
house, which they found deserted by all save
the proprietor and his family, the members of the
band having formed themselves into little squads
and strolled off toward the dock. Having made
sure that the coast was clear, Jones went out on
the back porch and gave a shrill whistle, to which
the deserter responded in person.</p>

<p>“Now, Lester,” said Jones, when Enoch entered
the house, “you stay here and act as look-out for
Williams, and I will take a scout about the village
and see how things look there. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
dark by the time I come back, and then we will
make a start.”</p>

<p>Jones was gone a long while, but the report he
brought was a favorable one. The members of the
band were all hidden about the dock, awaiting
Enoch’s appearance with much anxiety and impatience,
and Coleman was ready to carry out his
part of the contract. The sails were cast loose,
and all they had to do was to slip the anchor, and
let the current carry them down the river. He
had seen nothing of Captain Mack or his men, nor
had he been able to find any one who could tell
him what had become of them. He believed they
had gone back to camp.</p>

<p>“Mack rather plumes himself on his success in
capturing deserters, I believe,” said Enoch, as he
arose from the sofa on which he had been lounging
and put on his cap. “He fails sometimes,
doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Don’t shout until you are out of the woods,”
replied Jones, who knew that his friend was congratulating
himself on his cunning. “The pursuit
has not fairly begun. He may gobble you
yet and all the rest of us into the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will not cost him anything to try,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
said Enoch, confidently. “I am more at home on
the water than I am on land, and the boy who
beats me handling a yacht must get up in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“But they will follow us in tugs,” said Lester.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll hide among some of the islands in
the bay and let them hunt for us,” replied Enoch.
“I tell you it will be a cold day when we get left.”</p>

<p>After Lester had paid for the lunch they had
eaten in the grove, he and his companions left
Cony Ryan’s hospitable roof and set out for the
dock, neglecting no precautions on the way. Jones
and Lester went ahead, stopping at every corner
and looking into every doorway, and Enoch, who
followed a short distance behind them, did not
advance until they notified him, by a peculiar
whistle, that he had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>By keeping altogether on the back streets and
giving the business thoroughfares a wide berth,
they managed to reach the dock without meeting
anybody. There was no one in sight when they
got there, but Jones’s low whistle was answered
from a dozen different hiding places.</p>

<p>“Ahem!” said Enoch, looking toward the
schooner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ahem!” came the answer through the darkness.
“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“The band,” replied Enoch; and then there
came a few minutes of silence and impatient waiting,
during which Coleman got into his dory and
shoved off toward the dock. Another whistle
from Jones brought several students from their
places of concealment, and when the dory was
filled to its utmost capacity, it was pulled back to
the schooner. Coleman was obliged to make three
trips in order to take them all off, and when
Jones, who was the last to leave the dock, sprang
over the schooner’s rail, he announced that not a
single one of the band was missing.</p>

<p>“Keep silence fore and aft,” commanded Coleman,
as he made the dory’s painter fast to the
stern and went forward to slip the chain. “Wait
until we get under way before you do any
talking.”</p>

<p>The boys were careful to obey. With a single
exception they were highly elated over the success
of their plans, and now that the schooner was
moving off with them, they were determined that
she should not come back to her berth again until
she had taken them on a good long cruise. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
exception was, of course, Lester Brigham. He
became timid when he found himself at the mercy
of the current which was carrying him off through
darkness so intense that he could scarcely see the
vessel’s length ahead of him, and took himself to
task for his foolishness in proposing such an expedition.
But when he found that the schooner
was seaworthy, and that Enoch knew how to keep
her on top of the water and to get a good deal of
speed out of her besides, these feelings gradually
wore away, and he even told himself that he was
seeing lots of fun.</p>

<p>When the current had taken the little vessel so
far down the river that there was no longer any
danger to be apprehended, Coleman came up to
Enoch, whom he recognized as one of the leaders
of the band, and inquired:</p>

<p>“Are there any among you who know a halliard
from a down-haul?”</p>

<p>Enoch replied that there were.</p>

<p>“Then send a couple of them forward to run up
the jib, while I take the wheel,” said Coleman. “I
want to throw her head around. No singing, now.”</p>

<p>“What did he mean by that?” asked Lester,
speaking before he thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, have you never heard sailors sing when
they were hoisting the sails?” exclaimed Enoch.
“It makes the work easier, you know, and helps
them pull together.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course it does,” said Lester. “What
was I thinking of?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I am sure. Come with me
and lend a hand at the jib. Jones, you had better
attend to Coleman now.”</p>

<p>“Shall I give him his money?” asked Jones,
who, we forgot to say, had been elected treasurer
of the band without one dissenting voice.</p>

<p>“Yes; hand it over, and perhaps he will want
to go ashore and spend some of it. You see,”
added Enoch, as he and Lester went forward,
“our first hard work must be to get rid of Coleman
without raising any fuss, and Jones is going
to try to induce him to go off with us at
Windsor; so keep away from him and let him
talk.”</p>

<p>It was so very dark and there were so many
ropes leading down the foremast that Lester didn’t
see how Enoch could find the one he wanted; but
he laid his hand upon it without the least hesitation,
and when he began pulling at it, Lester knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
enough to take hold and help him. The schooner
swung around as the wind filled the sail, and
when her bow pointed down the river the fore and
main sails were hoisted, and in a few minutes
more she was bowling along right merrily. Enoch
superintended the work, all the boys lending willing
but awkward assistance, and Coleman complimented
him by saying that he was quite a
sailor.</p>

<p>“And I am the only one on board,” said he, as
soon as he found opportunity to speak to Jones
in private. “Brigham is a fraud of the first
water. There are lots of fellows aboard who
make no pretensions, but who know more about
a boat in five minutes than he does in a
month.”</p>

<p>“His yacht was a cutter, you know,” suggested
Jones.</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” exclaimed Enoch. “He
doesn’t know a cutter from a full-rigged ship.”</p>

<p>Lester, who was painfully aware that his ignorance
of all things pertaining to a yacht had been
fully exposed, was leaning against the weather-rail,
heartily wishing himself back at the academy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
He then and there resolved that he would
never again attempt to win a reputation among
his fellows by boasting. It is a bad thing to do;
and the boy who indulges in it is sure to bring
himself into contempt sooner or later.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">DON OBTAINS A CLUE.</span></h2>

<p>“How have you succeeded with Coleman?”
continued Enoch. “Are we going to get
rid of him as easily as we hoped?”</p>

<p>“Coleman is all right,” was Jones’s encouraging
reply. “I laid a neat little trap for him, and he
fell into it just as easy! I told him that we had
been followed nearly all day, and he said he knew
it, for he had seen Mack and some of his squad on
the dock. I told him, too, that Mack knew all
about the party at Windsor, and that I was afraid
he would go down there and lie in wait for us;
and Coleman offered to go ashore in the dory and
reconnoiter.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Enoch. “Just the minute
he is out of sight we’ll fill away for the bay. Now
let’s post the other boys, so that they may know
just what is expected of them.”</p>

<p>The deserters did not at all enjoy their ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
down the river, for they were thinking about
something else. They were impatient to see the
last of Coleman, and trembling for fear that something
would happen to excite his suspicions.
They were strong enough to take the schooner
from him by force, and there were some reckless
ones in the band who openly advocated it; but
the majority would not listen to them. They had
enough to answer for already, they said, and they
would not countenance any such high-handed proceeding.
While they were talking about it they
sighted Windsor.</p>

<p>“I guess I had better run in and tie up to the
wharf,” said Coleman, who stood at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” said Enoch, quickly. He
wanted to keep the schooner out in the river so
that when the proper time came he could fill away
without the loss of a moment. If she were made
fast to the wharf and the sails were lowered, it
would be a work of some difficulty to get under
way again, and if Coleman were the active and
quick-witted man they took him for, he would upset
all their plans in an instant.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t do at all,” chimed in Jones.
“How do we know but that Mack and his men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
are hidden there on the wharf all ready to board
us as soon as we come alongside?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you fight ’em off?” inquired Coleman.</p>

<p>“We might, but we’ll not try it,” said Enoch.
“There’s no law that prevents a deserter from
hiding or taking to his heels, but if he should resist
arrest, they’d snatch him bald-headed. We
don’t want to fight, for we’re deep enough in the
mud already.”</p>

<p>“What will the superintendent do to you when
you go back?” asked Coleman.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll court-martial us and stop our liberty,”
replied Jones. “But we don’t care for
that, you know. We intend to have so much fun
to-night at the party that we can afford to stay in
camp during the rest of the month.”</p>

<p>Jones did not think it best to tell Coleman that
he and his companions stood a fine chance of being
expelled from the academy to pay for this
night’s work. He was afraid that if he did, the
man would refuse to assist them in their scheme,
and that he would come about and take them
back to Bridgeport. If he had tried that, there
would have been trouble beyond a doubt, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
passengers were bound to make themselves famous
before they went back. They succeeded beyond
their most sanguine expectations. It is true that
they were taken to the academy under arrest, but
they were looked upon as heroes and not as culprits
who were deserving of punishment. They
gave the students and everybody else something
to talk about, but not in the way they had anticipated.</p>

<p>“The safest plan you can pursue is to leave the
schooner out here in the river, and go ashore in
the dory and see that the way is clear,” continued
Jones.</p>

<p>“I don’t know of but one house in Windsor
that is big enough for a party, and that’s Dr.
Norton’s,” said Coleman.</p>

<p>“There’s right where we’re going,” said Enoch,
at a venture. “We want you to go out there and
look carefully about his grounds to make sure
that Mack and his men are not in hiding there.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a mile from the village!” exclaimed
Coleman.</p>

<p>“What of that?”</p>

<p>“It would take me an hour to go there and
come back,” replied the man, “and to tell the truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
I am afraid to trust the yacht in your hands for
that length of time. You might beach her, or a
steamer might run her down in the dark.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of that,” replied Jones.
“Williams can take care of her. He owned and
sailed a yacht years ago.”</p>

<p>“And here’s another thing,” said Enoch. “You
ought to remember that you are as deeply interested
in this matter as we are. If Mack and his
men should capture us now, wouldn’t they find
out that you are using your owner’s yacht without
his knowledge, and wouldn’t they get you into
trouble by speaking of it?”</p>

<p>“So they would,” answered Coleman. “I didn’t
think of that. I must help you now whether I
want to or not. Well, I’ll go ashore, as I agreed.
Who’s going to manage the schooner while I am
gone?”</p>

<p>Enoch answered that he was.</p>

<p>“All right. Take the wheel, and let me see
you throw the yacht up into the wind.”</p>

<p>Enoch complied, and Coleman had no fault to
find with the way in which he executed the maneuver.
As soon as the schooner lost her headway,
the man clambered down into the dory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
pushed off toward the dock, not forgetting to tell
Enoch that he left the yacht entirely in his hands,
and that he (Enoch) would be responsible for her
safety.</p>

<p>“Don’t be uneasy,” was the boy’s reassuring
reply. “I know just what I want to do; and
I’m going to do it,” he added, in a lower tone.
“Go for’ard, Jones, and keep an eye on him as
long as you can. When you see him go up the
street that leads from the wharf, let me know.”</p>

<p>The impatient boys watched Coleman as he
rowed toward the dock, and presently they saw
his head bobbing up and down in front of the
lights in the store windows. As soon as he disappeared
up the road that led to Dr. Norton’s house,
Jones carried the news to Enoch, who filled away
and stood down the river again. The deserters
were so delighted at the success of their stratagem
that they danced hornpipes, and could with difficulty
restrain themselves from shouting aloud.</p>

<p>“Brigham, tell those fellows to keep still,”
commanded the new captain. “Now, Jones, the
next thing is something else. We’ve got the
schooner easy enough, but what shall we do with
her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s crack on and get into the bay as soon as
we can,” suggested Jones.</p>

<p>“I should like to, for I know we are not safe as
long as we are in the river, but I am afraid to put
any more canvas on her. Not being familiar with
the channel I am going it blind, and I don’t want
to knock a hole in her, or run her high and dry
on a sand-bar before I know it. I think it would
be safest to stay here for a while, and let our pursuers
get ahead of us, so that we will be in their
wake instead of having them in ours. Perhaps
you had better talk it up among the boys and see
what they think of it. While you are about it,
find out if there is any one in the band who knows
the river. If there is, send him to me.”</p>

<p>Jones hurried away to obey this order, and presently
returned with a boy who lived in Oxford,
and who had often piloted his father’s tugs up
and down the river. The information he gave the
captain was contained in a very few words, but it
proved to be of great value to him. The boy told
him that he had better keep as close to the bluff
banks as he could, for there was where the channel
was; but when he came to a place where the
banks were low on both sides, he would find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
deepest water pretty near the middle of the
river.</p>

<p>“That’s all I want to know about that,” said
Enoch. “It is eleven o’clock, isn’t it, and we are
about thirty-five miles from Bridgeport? Very
well. How much farther down the river ought the
current and this wind to take us by daylight?”</p>

<p>“I should think it ought to take us past Mayville,
and that is seventy miles from Bridgeport,”
replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Do you know of any little creeks around there
that we could hide in during the day?”</p>

<p>The boy said there were a dozen of them.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Enoch. “Perhaps you
had better stay on deck with me to-night, and to-morrow
we will sleep. Now Jones, divide the crew
into two equal watches, and send one of them
below if they are sleepy and want to go. Then
bring up a couple of lanterns and hang them to
the catheads. If we don’t show lights we may
get run over.”</p>

<p>Jones proved to be an invaluable assistant, and
it is hard to tell how Enoch would have got on
without him. He hung out the lamps, set the
watch, and then he and some of the band went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
below to take a look at their floating home. He
peeped into all the state-rooms, glanced at the
forecastle, examined all the lockers as well as the
galley and pantry, and was delighted with everything
he saw.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was so much elbow-room
on one of these little boats,” said he, after he had
finished his investigations. “There are provisions
enough in the store-rooms to last us a week, and
the owner has left his trunk and his hunting and
fishing traps on board.”</p>

<p>“That must not be touched,” said Enoch, decidedly.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do any harm to take out one of
those fine breech-loaders and knock over a mess of
squirrels with it,” said Jones.</p>

<p>“Yes, it would. Most men are very particular
about their guns and don’t want strangers to use
them. We must return all this property in just
as good order as it was when it came into our
hands. We’ve got money enough to buy our own
grub, and I’ll raise a row with the first fellow
who dips into those provisions, I don’t care who
he is. We’re not mean, if we did run away with
the schooner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps Egan would have been astonished to
have heard such sentiments as these expressed by
the boy whom he believed to be the “meanest
fellow that ever lived.” Enoch could be manly so
long as he was good-natured, and so could Lester
Brigham. It was when they got angry that they
showed themselves in their true characters. It
may be that the fear of a rigorous prosecution by
the angry owner of the yacht had something to do
with the stand Enoch took in regard to the provisions
and hunting outfit.</p>

<p>Of course none of the band wanted to go below,
inviting as the berths looked, and Enoch, who
liked company, did not insist upon it. They
showed a desire to sing, but that was something
the captain opposed. The noise they made would
be sure to attract the attention of some of the
people living along the banks, and put it in their
power to aid Captain Mack and his men when
they came in pursuit. He wanted to cover up
their trail so as to mystify everybody.</p>

<p>“You need not expect to do that,” said one of
the band. “Coleman will blow the whole thing
as soon as he gets home.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think he will go home and face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
his owner after what he has done,” said Enoch.
“I know I shouldn’t want to do it if I were in his
place. If he keeps away from Bridgeport, so
much the better for us. Wait till we get out of
danger, and then you can sing to your hearts’
content.”</p>

<p>Enoch stood at the wheel all night, and the boy
who lived in Oxford kept him company to see that
he gave the sand-bars a wide berth. Some of the
band managed to sleep a little, but the majority
of the members lounged about the deck and wondered
what they were going to do for excitement
during their cruise.</p>

<p>The schooner passed Mayville shortly after daylight,
and the deserters could not see that there
was any one stirring. About half an hour afterward
Enoch’s companion directed his attention to
a wide creek which he said would afford an excellent
hiding-place for their vessel during the day,
and the schooner was accordingly turned into it.
After she had run as far up the stream as the
wind would carry her, the sails were hauled down,
a dory they found in the creek was manned, a line
got out, and the yacht was towed around the
bend out of sight, and made fast to the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>And where were Captain Mack and his men all
this time, and did they succeed in finding the
trail of the deserters in spite of all Enoch’s efforts
to cover it up? They spent the night in their
quarters, and struck a hot scent the first thing in
the morning. It came about in this way:</p>

<p>When Lester Brigham, with Jones’s assistance,
succeeded in eluding Don Gordon, the latter became
firmly settled in the belief that there was
“something up.” He and Captain Mack used
their best endeavors to get on Lester’s track again,
looking in every place except the one in which
they would have been sure to find him. That
was at Cony Ryan’s house. As we said before,
they did not go there because they knew it would
be time wasted.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Gordon,” said Captain Mack, after
he and his squad had searched all the streets and
looked into every store in the village. “They’re
safe at Cony’s, and we might as well go home. I
hope they will stay out all night so that we can
have another chance to-morrow. I don’t like to
give up beaten.”</p>

<p>Captain Mack knew where to find every one of
his men, and in half an hour’s time they were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
marching back to camp. The young officer reported
his return and his failure to capture the
boy who had run the guard, adding that he had a
strong suspicion that Enoch, Lester and the rest
had some plan in their heads, and that they did
not intend to return to camp of their own free
will.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the superintendent. “If
they do not return to-night, you had better take a
squad and go down to the village in the morning
and make inquiries. If they can get away from
you they are pretty smart.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I will do my best, but I
can’t hope for success if I am to be hampered by
orders.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not,” said the superintendent,
with a laugh. “You would rather waste your
time in running about the country than stay here
in camp and attend to your business.”</p>

<p>“I am ahead of my class, sir,” said Mack.</p>

<p>“I know it. Well, stay out until you learn
all about their plans, if they have any, and capture
them if you know where they have gone. I
presume that is the order you want.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; that’s the very one,” said Mack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
with so much glee in his tones that the superintendent
and all the teachers laughed heartily.
“May I select my own men and take as many as
I want?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, provided you leave enough to do
camp duty.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir. I’ll take a man for every deserter.”</p>

<p>Captain Mack made his salute and hurried out,
laughing all over. His first care was to go to the
officer of the guard and find out just how many
boys there were in Lester’s party (he took it for
granted that they were all together and that they
intended to desert and go off somewhere to have a
good time), and his next to make out a list of the
boys who were to comprise his squad. It is hardly
necessary to say that the names of Don and Bert
Gordon, Egan, Curtis and Hopkins appeared on
that list. The captain meant to have a good time
himself, and he wanted some good fellows to help
him enjoy it.</p>

<p>“I have a roving commission, fellows,” he said
to the boys, as fast as he found them. “If I can
find out where those deserters have gone, I shall
not come back without them. Stick a pin
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good for you, Mack,” was the universal verdict.</p>

<p>“I tell you it pays for a fellow to mind his
business,” continued the delighted captain. “I
never would have been allowed so great a privilege
if I hadn’t behaved myself pretty well this term.
Say nothing to nobody, but hold yourselves in
readiness to leave camp at daylight. We’ll get
breakfast in the village. If you haven’t plenty of
money, perhaps you had better ask for some; and
while you are about it, you might as well get ten
dollars apiece. The superintendent is not very
particular about financial matters during camp,
you know.”</p>

<p>That was true, but still he looked surprised
when more than twenty boys came to him that
night and asked for ten dollars each. He handed
over the money, however, without asking any
questions, and when the last one went out he said
to the teachers who had gathered in his marquee:</p>

<p>“This looks as if Captain Mack were up to
something himself. Well, he’s a good boy, he
associates with none but good boys, and we can
trust him with the full assurance that any privileges
we grant him will not be abused.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Mack and his chosen men did not get
much sleep that night. Although they firmly
believed that a large party of students had
deserted the camp they had no positive proof of
the fact, and they were in a state of great uncertainty
and suspense. They hoped from the bottom
of their hearts that Lester and the rest would not
come in, for if they did, that was the end of the
fun. Some of them ran out of their tents every
time a sentry challenged, and always breathed
easier when they found that none of the suspected
parties had returned. At ten o’clock the challenges
ceased, and after that no one came through the
lines. Captain Mack went to the guard tent and
found that none of Lester’s crowd had returned,
and then he knew that his scout was an assured
thing. The band was gone sure enough, and the
next thing was to find it. All the members of
his squad reported for duty promptly at daylight
(not one of them waited to be called), and in five
minutes more they were on their way to the village.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said the captain, as he halted the
squad in front of the post-office, “scatter out, and
take a look about the streets for half an hour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
then report for breakfast at the International,
which will be our headquarters as long as we stay
here. I will go down there and tell them that we
want something to eat as soon as they can dish it
up.”</p>

<p>The boys “scattered out” in obedience to their
order, and a short time afterward Don Gordon
drew up at Haggert’s dock, where he found a
portly old gentleman who seemed to be greatly excited
about something, for he was striding back
and forth, talking to himself and flourishing his
cane in the air. This was Mr. Packard—the one
to whom Don and Bert presented their letter of
introduction on the night they got into trouble
with the guard, and saved Sam Arkwright from
being ducked in the big pond by Tom Fisher and
his followers.</p>

<p>“I declare I don’t understand this thing at all,”
said Mr. Packard, shaking his cane at Don, as the
latter came up and wished him a hearty good
morning.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” replied Don, who knew that
the angry old gentleman expected him to say
something.</p>

<p>“Now there’s that villain, Coleman,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Mr. Packard, bringing the iron ferrule of his heavy
stick down upon the dock to give emphasis to his
words. “I’ve done everything I could for that
man. I’ve footed his doctor bill when he was ill,
paid him more wages than he demanded, given
him employment when I didn’t really need him,
and now he’s gone and run off with my boat. I
say hanging is too good for such an ingrate. Come
up to the house and take breakfast with me, Don.
We haven’t seen you and Bert there in a long
time. What are you doing here at this hour in
the morning? Have you deserted again, you
young scamp?”</p>

<p>“No, <i>sir</i>,” said Don, emphatically. “I haven’t
been in a single scrape this term.”</p>

<p>“You were in that fight at Hamilton, and I
call that something of a scrape. Everybody says
you behaved with the greatest coolness. I am
proud of you, do you hear me?” said Mr.
Packard, again shaking his cane at Don.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” was the reply. “What I
meant to say was, that I have broken none of the
rules, and don’t mean to, either. Do you see this
bayonet? I am on duty, and consequently, I
am obliged, much to my regret, to decline your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
kind invitation. I am out after a lot of deserters.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll not catch them,” exclaimed Mr.
Packard. “Let them enjoy themselves while they
are young, for old age comes all too soon—too soon.
I haven’t forgotten that I was a boy once myself.
Come up to the house as often as you can—you
and Bert. We are always glad to see you.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman walked quickly away, and
then he as quickly stopped and shook his cane at
the anchor buoy which marked the berth in which
his schooner lay the last time he visited the dock.</p>

<p>“Now there’s that Coleman,” said he. “I’ll
give him till dark to bring that boat back, and if
he doesn’t do it, I’ll have the police after him. I
will, for I can’t stand any such nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” said Don; and he also left
the dock, performing a little problem in mental
arithmetic as he hurried away. Given a five-knot
breeze and a three-mile current, how far could a
vessel like the Sylph (that was the name of Mr.
Packard’s missing yacht) go in a narrow and
crooked channel in nine or ten hours? That was
the question he was trying to solve. While he
was working at it, he entered a telegraph office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and found the operator dozing in his chair. He
held a few minutes’ consultation with him, which
must have resulted in something that was entirely
satisfactory to Don, for when the latter came out
of the office and hurried toward the hotel, his face
wore an excited and delighted look. He found the
squad at breakfast, he being the last to report.</p>

<p>“What kept you?” demanded the captain, as
Don entered and took his seat at the table.</p>

<p>“Business,” was the laconic reply. “Have any
of you got a clue?”</p>

<p>No, they hadn’t. With all their trying they
had not been able to gain any tidings of the deserters,
who had disappeared in some mysterious way
and left no trace behind. Their leader, whoever
he was, had shown considerable skill in conducting
their flight so as to baffle pursuit.</p>

<p>“You’re a wise lot,” said Don. “I have a clue.”</p>

<p>A chorus of exclamations arose on all sides, and
the captain laid down his knife and fork and
settled back in his chair.</p>

<p>“I know right where they were about the time
we left camp this morning,” continued Don.</p>

<p>“Where were they?” exclaimed all the boys at
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“A long way from here. I tell you, Mack, the
superintendent didn’t dream of this when he gave
you your roving commission. Is it necessary that
you should report to him for further orders?”</p>

<p>“No. He told me to catch those fellows if I
could learn where they were, and that’s the only
order I want.”</p>

<p>“All right. What do you say to a sail on the
bay?”</p>

<p>The students raised a shout that made the spacious
dining-room echo. “Have they gone that
way?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“They have, and this is the way I found it out,”
answered Don, who, having worked his auditors
up to the highest pitch of excitement, went on to
repeat the conversation he had held with Mr.
Packard, and wound up by saying: “Somehow I
couldn’t help connecting the deserters with the
disappearance of that yacht; so I dropped into a
telegraph office, and the operator, at my request,
spoke to Mayville, who, after taking about fifteen
minutes to gain information, replied that the
Sylph had gone down the river at daylight with a
lot of students aboard.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Captain Mack; while his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
men broke out into a yell, pounded the table,
clapped their hands, and acted altogether so unlike
orderly guests of a first-class hotel, that the proprietor
came in to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>“Break all the dishes,” said he, swinging his
arms around his head. “Turn the house out of
doors, if you want to; it’s paid for!”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to stop before we do any damage,
Mr. Mortimer,” said Captain Mack, with a laugh.
“Now pitch in everybody, so that we can take the
first train.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going, Mack,” inquired Curtis.</p>

<p>“To Oxford. Egan is a sailor-man, and—you
know Mr. Shelby, of course.”</p>

<p>These words enabled the students to see through
Mack’s plan at once, and they made another boisterous
demonstration of delight and approval.
They knew Mr. Shelby, who owned the finest and
swiftest yacht in Oxford. He was an academy
boy, and had once been famous as a good runner.
He was a soldier as well as a sailor, as full of fun
and mischief as any boy in Mack’s squad, and just
the man to help Lester and his band with one
hand, while giving their pursuers a lift with the
other. Of course he would lend them his yacht<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and take as deep an interest in the race as any
student among them.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Don asked and obtained permission
to run up to Mr. Packard’s and let him know
what had become of the Sylph. To his great surprise
the old gentleman took it as a huge joke,
and laughed heartily over it. He warned Don
that the schooner was a hard boat to beat when
Coleman was at the helm, and declared that if the
deserters would return her safe and sound, they
might keep her a month and welcome. He would
never make them any trouble on account of it.
He was sorry to give up his cruise, but then his
brother had just left Newport in his yacht, and
when he arrived, he (Mr. Packard) would go off
somewhere with him. It was plain that his sympathies
were all with the runaways, although he
knew nothing of the great service they were going
to render him and others. If it hadn’t been for
those same deserters, Mr. Packard would never
again have seen his brother alive.</p>

<span class="smaller">ANOTHER TEST AND THE RESULT.</span></h2>

<p>“Keep her away, Burgess! If the ragged
end of that spar hits us it may send us to
the bottom. Slack away the fore-sheet! Stand
by, everybody, and don’t let him go by for your
lives! He looks as though he couldn’t hold on
another minute.”</p>

<p>It was Egan who issued these hurried orders.
He was standing on the weather-rail of Mr. Shelby’s
yacht, the Idlewild, which was sailing as near
into the wind’s eye as she could be made to go,
now and then buoying her nose in a tremendous
billow that broke into a miniature cataract on her
forecastle and deluged her deck with water. He
was drenched to the skin, and so were the boys
who were stationed along the rail below him,
trembling all over with excitement, and watching
with anxious faces one of the most thrilling scenes
it had ever been their lot to witness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been a terrible storm along the coast.
It was over now, the clouds had disappeared and
the sun was shining brightly; but the wind was
still blowing half a gale, there was a heavy sea
running, and the waves seemed to be trying their
best to complete the work of destruction that had
been commenced by the storm. Two points off
the weather-bow there had been, a few minutes
before, a little water-logged sloop, over which the
waves made a clean breach; but she was gone now.
All on a sudden her bow arose in the air, her stern
settled deep in the water, and the yacht, which
had set sail from Newport a few days before with
a merry party of excursionists on board, went
down to the bottom of the bay. Broad on the
Idlewild’s beam was the Sylph, the deserters working
like beavers to rescue the crew of the sunken
yacht, heedless or ignorant of the fact that they
were in jeopardy themselves, their vessel being so
badly handled by the frightened and inexperienced
boy at her wheel, that she was in imminent danger
of broaching to. Tossed about by the waves which
rolled between the Idlewild and the Sylph was a
broken spar to which a student, with a pale but
determined face, clung desperately with one arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
while in the other he supported the inanimate form
of a little boy. The student was Enoch Williams,
and the boy was Mr. Packard’s nephew.</p>

<p>The last time we saw the Sylph she was hiding
in the creek a short distance below Mayville.
That was a week ago, and her persevering and
determined pursuers had but just come up with
her. During the day the deserters purchased a
small supply of provisions from the neighboring
farmers, fished a little, slept a good deal, and when
darkness came to conceal their movements they
got under way again, and stood down the river,
taking the stolen dory with them. At daylight
they found another hiding-place, and before dawn
the next morning they ran by Oxford, a bustling
little city situated at the mouth of the river. If
they were pursued they did not know it. They
made cautious inquiries as often as they had opportunity,
but no one could give them any information,
because Captain Mack and his men had
escaped observation by going from Bridgeport to
Oxford on the cars.</p>

<p>When the Sylph ran out into the bay, the deserters
began to feel perfectly safe. They shouted
and sung themselves hoarse, and told one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that they were seeing no end of sport; but in
their hearts they knew better. How was their
cruise going to end? was the unwelcome question
that forced itself into their minds every hour in the
day, and none of them could answer it satisfactorily.
It might be a daring exploit to run off with
a private yacht, but they didn’t think so now that
the mischief was done, and there was not one
among them who did not wish that he had taken
some other way to get out of the academy. Enoch
very soon became disgusted. The wind being brisk
he was obliged to be at the wheel nearly all the
time, and he couldn’t see the fun of working so
steadily while the rest of the band were lying
around doing nothing.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what’s a fact,” said he to Jones,
one day. “There’s too much of a sameness about
this thing to suit me. I have the best notion in
the world to desert the yacht the next time we go
ashore, and strike a straight course for home.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking seriously of the same
thing,” answered Jones.</p>

<p>“It’s a cowardly thing to do,” continued Enoch,
“but when I fall to thinking of the settlement
that’s coming, I can’t sleep, it troubles me so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Suppose the man who owns this yacht is one who
can’t take a joke! Do you know that we have
rendered ourselves liable to something worse than
expulsion from the academy?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that until it was too late,”
said Jones.</p>

<p>“Neither did I; nor did I think to ask myself
what my father would say and do about it. I
believe our best plan would be to go back and put
the schooner in her berth. It will take us four or
five days to do that, and during that time each
fellow can decide for himself how he will act
when we get to Bridgeport—whether he will
go home, or return to the academy and face the
music.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” exclaimed Jones. “I
know what I shall do. I shall get into camp,
if I can, without being caught, and report for
duty. Let’s all do that, and if we return the
schooner in as good order as she was when we
found her, we shall escape the disgrace of being
sent down, and at the same time have the satisfaction
of knowing that we have done something
that no other crowd ever attempted. After we
get home we can tell our fathers that we don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
want to come back to school, and perhaps we can
induce them to listen to us. That fight with
the mob will be in our favor, for after our folks
have had time to think it over calmly, they’ll
not willingly put us in the way of getting into
another. That’s the best plan, and you may
depend upon it.”</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” said Enoch. “Call the
boys aft and ask them what they think about it.”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the runaways
were delighted with the prospect of escaping the
consequences of their folly. Their cruise among
the islands of the bay had been almost entirely
devoid of interest. It is true that they had raided
a few melon-patches and corn-fields, and that a
little momentary excitement had been occasioned
by the discovery of suspicious sails behind them;
but their foraging had been accomplished with
small difficulty and without detection, and the
sails belonged to coasters which held their course
without paying any attention to the schooner.
Without giving Jones, who did the talking, time to
enter fully into an explanation, the deserters broke
into cheers, and some of them urged the captain to
turn the schooner’s bow toward Oxford at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am afraid to do it,” said Enoch, as soon as
he could make himself heard. “Just turn your
eyes in that direction for a moment.”</p>

<p>The boys looked, and saw a milk-white cloud,
followed by one as black as midnight, rapidly rising
into view above the horizon. Underneath, the
sea was dark and threatening.</p>

<p>“There’s wind in those clouds, and plenty of it,
too,” continued the captain. “If we are caught
in it we are gone deserters. Our only chance for
safety is to make the lee of that island you see
ahead of us.”</p>

<p>The runaways watched the clouds with a good
deal of anxiety. Up to this time the wind had
been fair and the weather all they could have
desired; but now it looked as though the Storm
King were about to show them what he could do
when he got into a rage. The clouds came up
with startling rapidity; the lightning began playing
around their ragged edges, the mutterings of
distant thunder came to their ears, and their
haven of refuge seemed far away; but fortunately
the breeze held out, and just a few minutes before
the wind changed with a roar and a rush, and the
storm burst forth in all its fury, the Sylph dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
her spare anchor in a sheltered nook under the lee
of the island, and with everything made snug, was
prepared to ride it out. The rain fell in torrents,
driving the boys below and keeping them there
until long after midnight. The wind blew as
they had never heard it blow before, but the anchor
held, and shortly before daylight the thunder
died away in the distance, and finally the sun
arose in unclouded splendor. The runaways were
all hungry, for they had had no supper, and as
their provisions were all exhausted, some of them
began to talk of laying violent hands upon those
in the lockers.</p>

<p>“There’s no need of doing that,” said Enoch,
after he had taken a look around. “All hands
stand by to get ship under way. It doesn’t blow
to hurt anything, and we’ll take the back track
without any delay. After a glorious spin over
these waves, we’ll stop for breakfast at the island
where we robbed our last corn-field. It’s only a
few miles away, and it will make the Sylph laugh
to run down there with such a breeze as this.”</p>

<p>The deserters had become accustomed to yield
prompt and unquestioning obedience to Enoch’s
orders, but there were some among them who did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
not at all like the idea of going out of the cove to
face the white caps that were running in the bay.
If there had been any one to propose it and to
direct their movements afterward, a few of them
would have refused duty; but the majority, having
confidence in Enoch’s skill and caution, went
to work to get the chain around the little windlass
which served the Sylph in lieu of a capstan,
and when they shipped the handspikes, the timid
ones took hold and helped run the vessel up to her
anchor. She was got under way without difficulty,
and as long as she remained behind the
island where the wind was light and the sea comparatively
smooth, she made such good weather
of it that Lester Brigham and those like him,
began to take courage; and they even struck up:
“Here let my home be, in the waters wide,” to
show how happy they were, and how much they
enjoyed the rapid motion. But their song ceased
very suddenly when they rounded the promontory
at the foot of the island, and saw what there was
before them. In front, behind and on both sides
of them were tumbling, white-capped billows,
whose tops were much higher than the schooner’s
rail, and which came rolling slowly and majestically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
toward them, but with dreadful force and
power. It seemed as if every one of them were
higher than its predecessor, and that nothing
could save the Sylph, which bounded onward
with increased speed.</p>

<p>“This is something like a sail!” shouted
Enoch, who was all excitement now. “This is
what puts life into a fellow. I wish some other
schooner would show up, so that we could have a
race with her. How she flies!”</p>

<p>“Look out or you’ll tip us over,” whined Lester,
who was holding on for life.</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” replied Enoch. “The
Sylph is no ‘skimming-dish.’ She’s deep as well
as wide, and being built for safety instead of
speed, I couldn’t capsize her if I should try.”</p>

<p>“There’s the boat you were wishing for,” said
Jones, suddenly. “Now you can have a race if
you want it.”</p>

<p>Enoch looked around, and was surprised as well
as startled to see a handsome little yacht scarcely
more than a mile distant from them and following
in their wake. She was carrying an immense
spread of canvas, considering the breeze that was
blowing and the sea that was running, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
her captain was not satisfied with the speed she
was making was evident from the fact that while
the deserters looked at her, they saw a couple of
her crew mount to the cross-trees to shake out the
gaff-topsails.</p>

<p>“That’s the most suspicious-looking fellow we
have seen yet,” remarked Enoch, after he had
taken a good look at the stranger. “He don’t
crack on in that style for nothing. Hallo! what’s
the matter with you?” he added, as Jones gave
a sudden start and came very near dropping the
spy-glass which he had leveled at the yacht.</p>

<p>“They’re after us, as sure as the world,” exclaimed
Jones, in great excitement. “Those fellows
who are going aloft are dressed in uniform.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re as good as captured,” said Enoch,
spitefully. “There isn’t a single boy in the band
who can go up and loosen the topsails, or whom I
dare trust at the wheel while I do it. If I had as
good a crew as he has, I’d beat him or carry something
away; but what can I do with a lot of
haymakers.”</p>

<p>“There’s another boat right ahead of us,” said
one of the deserters.</p>

<p>Enoch was not a little astonished as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
frightened by the sight that met his gaze when
he turned his eyes from the pursuing yacht to the
boat in advance of them. He expected to find
that she also was full of students; but instead of
that she was a complete wreck. Her mast had
gone by the board and was now dragging alongside,
pounding the doomed yacht with fearful violence
every time a wave rose and fell beneath it.
There was no small boat to be seen, and Enoch
thought at first that the sloop had been abandoned;
but when she was lifted on the crest of a
billow and he obtained a better view of her, he
was horrified to discover that there were three
men and a woman lashed to the rigging. The
sight was a most unexpected one, and for a minute
or two Enoch could not speak. He stood as if he
had grown fast to the deck, and then all the manhood
there was in him came to the surface. Those
helpless people must be taken off that wreck at
all hazards. He looked at the pursuing yacht,
and then he looked at the sloop. The former was
coming up hand over hand, but she was still far
away, and the sloop might go to the bottom at
any moment. Probably she was kept afloat by
water-tight compartments. The spar that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
towing alongside would very soon smash them in,
and then she would go down like a piece of lead,
being heavily ballasted and having no buoyant
cargo to sustain her.</p>

<p>“Jones,” said Enoch, speaking rapidly but
calmly, “you have stood by me like a good fellow
so far, and you mustn’t go back on me now.
Come here and take the wheel. I am going to
save that lady or go to the bottom while trying.”</p>

<p>“Are you going off in the dory?” faltered
Jones, as he laid his hands upon the wheel.</p>

<p>“Of course. There’s nothing else I can do.”</p>

<p>“Then you will go to the bottom, sure enough.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it if I do,” said Enoch, desperately.
“I will throw the yacht up into the wind
before I go, and all you’ve got to do is to hold the
wheel steady and keep her there till I get back—if
I ever do. I say, fellows,” he added, addressing
the frightened boys who were gathered around
him, “I am going off in the dory after that lady,
and I want one of you to go with me. Who’ll
volunteer?”</p>

<p>The deserters were so astonished that there was
no immediate response. The dory was small, the
waves were high, and it looked like certain death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to venture out among them. After a moment’s
indecision one of them stepped forward and prepared
himself for the ordeal by discarding his coat
and hat and kicking off his boots. Who do you
suppose it was? It was Lester Brigham. The
boy who had hidden his head under the bed-clothes
when he thought that the rioters were coming
to attack the academy, now showed, to the surprise
of everybody, that he was not a coward after
all. Enoch could not have picked out an abler
assistant. He was a good oarsman, he could swim
like a duck, and, better than all, his courage
never faltered when he found himself in the dory
battling with the waves. His companions, who
dared not go on so perilous a mission themselves,
cheered him loudly as he stepped forward, and
Enoch shook him warmly by the hand, saying in
a low tone:</p>

<p>“We said we would give the academy boys
something to talk about, and now we’re going to
do it.”</p>

<p>The schooner ran on by the wreck, whose crew,
seeing that an attempt was to be made to rescue
them, cheered faintly, but made no effort to free
themselves from their lashings. The reason was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
because they were utterly exhausted, and they
were afraid that if they loosed their bonds, the
first wave that broke over the sloop’s deck would
carry them into the sea.</p>

<p>As soon as the Sylph had been thrown up into
the wind, Enoch and Lester, whose faces were
white but resolute, scrambled down into the dory,
and the struggle began. The waves tossed their
little craft about like an egg-shell, but they kept
manfully on, and in ten minutes more, they were
alongside the wreck. The lady, who was insensible
from fright or exposure, was the first to be
released and placed in the boat, and then the men
were taken care of, one after the other. As Enoch
approached the last one, he saw that the man carried
in his arms a bundle that was wrapped up in
a blanket. He held fast to it, too, in spite of the
boy’s efforts to take it from him; but as Enoch
assisted him toward the dory, a wave, higher than
the rest, knocked them both off their feet, and as
the man was hauled into the boat Enoch missed
the frantic grasp he made at a life-line, and the
water rushing across the deck carried him overboard.
Close in front of him was the bundle
which had slipped from the grasp of the rescued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
man when he lost his footing. As the wave
hurried it across the deck toward an opening in
the bulwarks the blanket fell off, revealing to
Enoch’s astonished gaze the handsome features of
a little four-year-old boy, who turned his blue eyes
pleadingly toward him for an instant, and then
disappeared over the side. Enoch made a desperate
clutch at the golden curls, and when he arose
to the surface, he brought his prize with him;
but he had to go down again the next moment to
escape destruction from the spar, which the next
wave brought toward him broadside on. It had
been torn from its fastenings at last, but it had
done its deadly work. There was a great hole in
the sloop’s side, and the water was pouring into it.</p>

<p>“I say, Lester!” shouted Enoch, as he came
up on the other side of the spar, shook the water
from his face and held the boy aloft so that he
could breathe. “Get away from there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my boy!” cried one of the men in the
dory, who now discovered that he had lost the
precious burden to which he had so lovingly
clung through long hours of exposure and suffering.</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” shouted Enoch, encouragingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
“I’ve got a good grip on him. Lester, I tell you
to get away from there! Hold the dory head on
to the waves, and she’ll ride them without shipping
a drop of water. If the Sylph doesn’t make
stem-way enough to pick you up, the other yacht
will take care of you.”</p>

<p>Not knowing just how much of a swirl the sloop
would make when she went to the bottom, Enoch
exerted all his powers as a swimmer to get himself
and his burden out of reach of it. He succeeded
in his object, and when the wreck had
sunk out of sight and he thought it safe to do so,
he swam back to the spar and laid hold of it.
Then he looked around for the dory. She had been
hauled alongside the Sylph by aid of the line that
one of the crew had been thoughtful enough to
throw to her, and the sloop’s crew were being
hoisted over the rail one after the other.</p>

<p>“Hard a starboard! Stand by, everybody,”
shouted a voice above him.</p>

<p>The pursuing yacht came gracefully up into the
wind, and as the bold swimmer was lifted on the
crest of a wave strong hands grasped his arms, and
he and his prize were lifted out of the water and
over the rail to the Idlewild’s deck.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ROD AND GUN CLUB.</span></h2>

<p>The first southward bound train that passed
through Bridgeport on the morning that
Don Gordon so unexpectedly obtained a clue to
the whereabouts of the deserters, took him and all
the rest of Captain Mack’s men to Oxford. Although
the young officer had full authority to act
in this way, he did not omit to drop a note into
the post-office, telling the superintendent where
he had gone and what he intended to do.</p>

<p>“He’ll not get it before ten o’clock,” said the
captain, gleefully, “and by that time we shall be
so far away that he will not think it worth while
to recall us, or to send a teacher after us.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want any teacher with us,” said
Don. “We can do this work ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Of course we can; and what’s more, we’re
going to. Now, keep out of sight, all of us, and
don’t go out on the platform when we stop at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
stations. We don’t want to see any despatches.
We’re doing this ourselves, and having begun it,
we want to go through with it.”</p>

<p>The next time the superintendent heard from
Captain Mack and his men they were at Oxford,
and ready to continue the pursuit in the Idlewild,
which was lying to in the river when Mack sent
the despatch. In fact he took pains to see that
everything was ready for the start before he went
near the telegraph office. He got the yacht, as
he knew he would, without the least trouble (Mr.
Shelby laughed heartily when he heard what the
deserters had done, and said he wished he had
thought of such a thing when he was a boy), laid
in a stock of provisions and water, and then turned
the management of affairs over to Egan, who
selected his crew and got the yacht under way.
When she came abreast of the city (the berth she
usually occupied was about a mile up the river)
Mack went ashore in the dory, and after sending
off his despatch, telling the superintendent where
he was and what he intended to do next, he
plumed himself on having done his full duty as a
gentleman and an officer.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t stop us now if he wanted to,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
said Mack, as he returned aboard and the Idlewild
filled away for the bay, “for there are no telegraph
offices outside, and if we see a tug after us, we’ll
hide from her. But the superintendent can’t say
that I didn’t keep him posted, can he?”</p>

<p>The pursuing vessel had a much better crew
than the Sylph—of the twenty-three boys aboard
of her there were an even dozen who could go
aloft and stand their trick at the wheel—and if
she had once come in sight of the deserters, she
would have overhauled them in short order; but
the trouble was to get on the track of them.
There was a good deal of territory in the bay—it
was about a hundred miles long and half as wide—and
there were many good hiding-places to be
found among the numerous islands that were
scattered about in it. For five days they sailed
about from point to point, but could gain no tidings
of Enoch and his crowd. The island farmers,
of whom they made inquiries, declared that Captain
Mack and his squad were the only academy
boys who had been seen on the bay that summer.
If the deserters had left the corn-fields and melon-patches
alone, their pursuers might not have been
able to get on their track at all; but one irate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
truck-gardener, whom they had despoiled of nearly
a cart-load of fine watermelons which were in
prime condition for the Oxford market, gave them
the needed information, and after that their work
was easy. They traced the Sylph from island to
island, gaining on her every hour, and would have
overhauled her before the close of the day on which
the storm came up, had they not been obliged to
seek a safe anchorage from the gale.</p>

<p>During the night of the blow the little vessels
were not more than five miles apart. The Idlewild
made the earlier start, and if the Sylph had
remained in the cove an hour longer she would
have been captured there, for it was Egan’s intention
to coast along the lee-shore of that very
island. As it was, he did not catch sight of the
object of his search until she rounded the promontory
and stood up the bay. Then all was excitement
on the Idlewild’s deck.</p>

<p>“Hold her to it, Burgess,” said Egan to the
boy at the wheel. “The Sylph’s got the weather-gauge
of us now, but we can soon gain the wind
of her. At any rate we’ll make her captain show
what he’s made of. Go aloft, a couple of you,
and we’ll set the topsails.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you going to lay us alongside of her?”
asked Burgess.</p>

<p>“Not in this sea,” replied Egan. “We’ll keep
her company until she gets into smooth water,
and then we’ll bounce her. What do you see,
Gordon?” he added, addressing himself to Bert
who was gazing steadily at something through the
glass.</p>

<p>“I never saw a wreck,” replied Bert, handing
the glass to Egan, “but if that isn’t one, tossing
about on the waves just ahead of the Sylph, I’d
like to know what it is.”</p>

<p>Egan looked, and an exclamation indicative of
the profoundest astonishment fell from his lips.
It was a wreck, sure enough, said all the boys, as
the glass was passed rapidly from hand to hand,
and there were people on it, too. Now what was
to be done?</p>

<p>“Stow the topsails and lay down from aloft,”
commanded Egan. “We don’t want any more
canvas on her until we have taken care of those
castaways.”</p>

<p>Never before had the Idlewild bore so excited a
party as Captain Mack and his men were at that
moment, and never had she carried a more orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
one. There was not the slightest confusion among
them. Those who understood Egan’s hurried
orders obeyed them, and those who did not, kept
out of the way. When they saw that the deserters
were making preparations to board the wreck,
their admiration found vent in lusty and long-continued
cheers.</p>

<p>“Who are those fellows in the dory?” Egan
asked of Don, who had the glass. “They have
good pluck, I must say.”</p>

<p>“One of them is Enoch Williams, and the
other is——”</p>

<p>Don was so utterly amazed by the discovery he
had made, that he could go no further. He wiped
both ends of the glass with his handkerchief to
make sure that there was nothing on them to obscure
his vision, and then he looked again.</p>

<p>“The other is Lester Brigham,” said he.</p>

<p>His companions could hardly believe it. First
one and then another took the glass, and every one
who gazed through it, gave utterance to some expression
of astonishment.</p>

<p>“I’ll never again be in such haste to pass
judgment upon a fellow,” said Egan, after he had
satisfied himself that Enoch’s companion was none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
other than the boy who had faltered when his
courage was first tested. “I have been badly
mistaken in both those boys. You are going
to capture the deserters, Mack, but Enoch and
Lester will go back to Bridgeport with a bigger
feather in their caps than you will.”</p>

<p>Captain Mack did not feel at all envious of
them on that account. He and the rest watched
all their movements with the keenest solicitude,
and cheered wildly every time one of the sloop’s
crew was released from his lashings and put into
the dory. When that big wave came and washed
Enoch overboard, their hearts seemed to stop beating,
and every boy anxiously asked his neighbor
whether or not Enoch could swim well enough to
keep himself afloat until they could reach him.
Their fears on that score were speedily set at
rest and their astonishment was greatly increased
when Egan, who held the glass, said that he could
swim like a cork, that he held a little child
in his arms, and that he knew enough to get
beyond the influence of the whirlpool made by
the wreck which was now going to the bottom.</p>

<p>“He’s a hero!” cried Egan, after he had
shouted himself hoarse. “Look out for that spar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Burgess! Get handspikes, some of you, and
stand by to push her off!”</p>

<p>But the handspikes were not needed. Being
skilfully handled the Idlewild came up into the
wind within easy reach of the spar, but never
touching it, and hung there barely a moment—just
long enough to give the eager boys who were
stationed along the weather-rail, time to seize the
swimmer and haul him aboard. He was none the
worse for his ducking, while his burden lay so
white and motionless in his arms that everybody
thought he was dead; but he was only badly
frightened, and utterly bewildered by the strange
and unaccountable things that were going on
around him.</p>

<p>“Now, then, what does a fellow do in cases like
this?” exclaimed Don, who was at sea in more
respects than one.</p>

<p>“Take the boy below and put him to bed,”
commanded Egan. “Pull off those wet clothes,
give him a good rubbing to set his blood in motion,
and then cover him up warmly and let him
go to sleep. I suppose his father is among those
whom you and Lester took off the wreck?”</p>

<p>“I think he is, and his mother too,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Enoch, who was wringing the water out of his
coat.</p>

<p>“His mother!” cried Egan.</p>

<p>“Yes. The first one we took off was a lady.”</p>

<p>“Who are they, and where did they come
from?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the shadow of an idea. I don’t know
the name of their vessel, or whether or not any of
the crew were lost. The lady was insensible, and
the men were not much better off.”</p>

<p>“Then we must run for a doctor!” exclaimed
Mack.</p>

<p>“You can’t get to one any too quick,” answered
Enoch. “But first, you had better send somebody
off to take charge of that schooner. Jones
is at the wheel, and he can’t handle her in this
wind.”</p>

<p>Captain Mack lost no time in acting upon this
suggestion. While the Idlewild was taking up a
position on the Sylph’s starboard quarter, her small
boat, which had been housed on deck, was put
into the water, half the squad, six of whom were
capable of managing the schooner, were sent off
to take charge of the prize, and the majority of
the deserters were transferred to the Idlewild.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Bert Gordon, who was the only non-commissioned
officer in the squad, commanded the Sylph, but
Burgess sailed her. All this work was done as
soon as possible, and when it was completed the
two vessels filled away for the nearest village, the
Idlewild leading the way. During the run the
deserters fraternized with their captors, and many
interesting and amusing stories of the cruise were
told on both sides. The former were treated as
honored guests instead of prisoners, and Mack and
his men praised them without stint.</p>

<p>“We’re all right, fellows,” said Jones, when he
had opportunity to exchange a word with Lester
and Enoch in private. “The superintendent won’t
say anything to us. He can’t after what we have
done.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t all do as well as Enoch did,”
said Lester.</p>

<p>“I know that. He will receive the lion’s share
of the honors, but the rest of us did the best we
could, and if one is let off scot free, the others
must be let off too. Those people would have gone
to the bottom with their yacht if we hadn’t
sighted them just as we did; and by rescuing them
we have made ample amends for our misdeeds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>All the deserters seemed to be of the same
opinion, and the boys who, but a short time before,
would have shrunk from meeting the gaze of their
teachers, now looked forward to their return to
camp with the liveliest anticipations of pleasure.
There was one thing they all regretted, now that
the fun was over, and that was, that the confiding
Coleman had lost his situation through them.
They resolved, if they could gain the ear of the
Sylph’s owner, to make an effort to have him reinstated.
Fortunately for Coleman, this proved
to be an easy thing to do.</p>

<p>It was twenty miles to the nearest village, but
the fleet little vessels, aided by the brisk wind
that was blowing, covered the distance in quick
time. The moment the Sylph came within jumping
distance of the wharf, one of her crew sprang
ashore and started post-haste for a doctor, and
shortly afterward Burgess and another of Bert’s
men boarded the Idlewild.</p>

<p>“The lady is coming around all right and wants
to see her boy,” said the former.</p>

<p>The little fellow was fast asleep in one of the
bunks, and his clothes were drying in the galley;
so Burgess picked him up, blankets and all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
carried him off to his mother, while his companion
lingered to give Captain Mack some account of the
rescued people who, he said, were able to talk now,
but too weak to sit up. They were from Newport,
and they were all relations of Mr. Packard, the
Sylph’s owner. The owner and captain of the
lost sloop was Mr. Packard’s brother, and the
little boy was his nephew. The lady was the captain’s
wife. They had been out in all that storm,
and after the men had worked at the pumps until
their strength failed them, they had lashed themselves
to the rigging in the hope that their disabled
craft would remain afloat until the waves
could carry her ashore.</p>

<p>“But she wouldn’t have gone ashore,” said
Egan. “She would have missed the island and
been carried out to sea if she had stayed above
water.”</p>

<p>“They know that,” said the student, “and
they know, too, that they owe their lives to the
Sylph, for they would have gone down before the
Idlewild could have reached them. They feel
very grateful toward the dory’s crew, and Mr.
Packard says he will never forget the gallant fellow
who saved his boy’s life at the risk of his own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>These words were very comforting to the deserters.
The owner of the Sylph was one of the
prominent men of Bridgeport, and it was not at
all likely that he would neglect to use his influence
with the superintendent in behalf of the boys
who had saved his relatives from a watery grave.
Lester Brigham could hardly contain himself. He
had won a reputation at last, and the hated Gordons
were nowhere. He believed now that he
would stay at the academy, and Enoch, Jones and
the rest of them had about come to the same conclusion.
They all wanted warrants and commissions,
and who could tell but that their recent
exploit would give them the favor of the teachers,
who would see that their desires were gratified?</p>

<p>At daylight the next morning Bert Gordon sent
word to Captain Mack that the doctor thought
his patients were now able to continue the journey
to Bridgeport. No time was lost in getting under
way, and at dark they were in Oxford. The Idlewild
was turned over to her owner in just as good
condition as she was when she left port, and Captain
Mack, after seeing the rescued people to a
hotel, at which they intended to remain for a day
or two in order to obtain the rest they so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
needed, and sending despatches to the superintendent
and Mr. Packard, took the first train for
Bridgeport with the deserters and the main body
of his men, leaving Bert, Egan, and six others to
bring the Sylph up the river. Before she was
hauled into her berth the camp had been broken,
the students had marched back to the academy,
and the examination was going on as if nothing
had happened during the term to draw the students’
attention from their books. Mr. Packard
had responded to Captain Mack’s telegram by
going down to Oxford and bringing his relatives
back with him, and the townspeople were almost
as highly excited over what the deserters had
done, as they were when they learned that an
academy company had put down the Hamilton
riot. There were some among them who declared
that Enoch and Lester ought to be promoted;
but the superintendent was of a different opinion.
He admired their courage, but he could not lose
sight of the fact that in stealing a private yacht
and running off in her, they had done something
for which they ought to be expelled from the
academy. In fact that was the sentence that was
passed upon them by the court-martial; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
superintendent set it aside, as everybody knew he
would, and commuted their punishment to deprivation
of standing and loss of every credit mark
they had earned during the year, thus destroying
their last chance for promotion.</p>

<p>The examination came to a close in due time,
and the result astonished everybody. Don Gordon
made the longest jump on record, springing
from the ranks to a position “twelve yards in the
rear of the file-closers, and opposite the centre of
the left wing” of the battalion. In other words,
he became major; Bert was made a first-lieutenant,
and Sam Arkwright, the New York boot-black,
was promoted to a second-lieutenancy.
This was enough to disgust Lester and Enoch,
and not even the satisfaction they felt at being
invited to dinner and made much of at Mr. Packard’s
residence, could make them good-natured
again. Forgetting that the position a boy occupied
in that academy was determined by his
standing as a student and a soldier, and not by
any acts of heroism he might perform while on a
runaway expedition, they laid Don’s rapid promotion
to favoritism, and threatened him and the
teachers accordingly. As for Don, who had simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
tried to behave himself, hoping for no higher
round than a lieutenant’s commission, he was
fairly stunned; and as soon as he had somewhat
recovered himself, his first thought was to enjoin
secrecy upon his brother.</p>

<p>“Don’t lisp a word of this in your letters to
mother,” said he. “Tell her that the result of
the examination is perfectly satisfactory to both
of us, and let her be content with that until she
sees our shoulder-straps.”</p>

<p>Lester Brigham pursued an entirely different
course. The papers were full of the exploit the
deserters had performed on the bay, and whenever
he found an article relating to it that was
particularly flattering to his vanity, he cut it out
and sent it to his father. He wanted him and
everybody else about Rochdale to know what a
brave boy he was.</p>

<p>The examination over, two parties of students
left the academy and started off to enjoy their
vacation in their own way, Lester and his friends
heading for Mississippi, and Curtis and <i>his</i> friends
striking for the wilds of Maine. The latter had
long ago sent for their guns, which arrived during
their first week in camp. Bert, whose highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
ambition was to bag a brace or two of ruffed
grouse, carried his little fowling-piece; Don, who
had an eye on the moose and caribou which, so
Curtis told him, were still to be found on the
hunting-grounds he intended to show them, had
sent for his muzzle-loading rifle; while Egan and
Hopkins were armed with the same ponderous
weapons with which they had worked such havoc
among the ducks and quails about Diamond Lake.
To these outfits were added fly-rods, reels and
baskets which they purchased in Boston, Curtis
making their selections for them. The Southern
boys were astonished when they handled the neat
implements that were passed out for their inspection.</p>

<p>“I don’t want this pole,” said Don, who was
holding an elegant split-bamboo off at arm’s
length. “It’s too limber. It isn’t strong enough
to land a minnow.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t a pole; it’s a rod,” said Curtis.
“Of course it is very light and elastic, and you
couldn’t throw a fly with it if it were not; but it’s
strong enough to land any fish you are likely to
catch in Maine. I suppose you have been in the
habit of yanking your fish out by main strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
haven’t you? Well, that’s no way to do. You’d
better take it if you want to see fun.”</p>

<p>Don took it accordingly, though not without
many misgivings, and the other boys also paid for
the rods that Curtis selected for them, carrying
them out of the store as gingerly as though they
had been made of glass. But there proved to be
any amount of strength and durability in those
same frail-looking rods, and their owners caught
many a fine string of trout with them before the
season closed.</p>

<p>Their journey from Boston to Dalton, which
was the name of the little town in which Curtis
lived, was a pleasant though an uneventful one.
The last fifty miles were made by stage-coach—a
new way of traveling to the Southern boys, who,
of course, wanted to ride on the top. About ten
o’clock at night the stage drove into the village,
and after stopping at the post-office to leave the
mail, and at the principal hotels to drop some of
its passengers, it kept on to Curtis’s home. Late
as the hour was, they found the house filled with
boys who had gathered there to welcome their
friend who had been in a real battle since they
last saw him, and to extend a cordial greeting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the comrades he had brought with him. They
were introduced to the new-comers, one after the
other, as members of <i>The Rod and Gun Club</i>,
which, according to Curtis’s way of thinking,
could boast of more skillful fishermen, and finer
marksmen, both at the trap and on the range,
than any other organization of like character in
the State. There were nearly a score of them in
all, and they seemed to be a jolly lot of fellows.
Some of them had performed feats with the rod
and gun that were worth boasting of, and as fast
as Curtis found opportunity to do so, he pointed
them out to his guests, and told what they had
done to make themselves famous. That tall,
slender, blue-eyed boy who stood over there in the
corner, talking to Mr. Curtis, had won the club
medal by breaking a hundred glass-balls in succession,
when thrown from a revolving trap. He
was ready to shoot against any boy in the country
at single or double rises, and Curtis was going to
try to induce Don Gordon to consent to a friendly
trial of skill with him. That fellow over there on
the sofa, who looked enough like Hopkins to be
his brother, was the champion fisherman. He
had been up in Canada with his father, and during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the sixteen days he was there, he had caught
more than eight hundred pounds of fish with one
rod. They were all salmon. One of them weighed
thirty-two pounds, and it took the young fisherman
fifty minutes to bring him within reach of
the gaff. The boy who was talking with Don
Gordon was a rifle shot. He could shoot ten balls
into the same hole at forty yards off-hand, and
think nothing of it.</p>

<p>“I’ll just tell you what’s a fact,” said Egan,
when he and the rest were getting ready to go to
bed,“we’ve fallen among a lot of experts, and if
we intend to keep up the good name of our section
of the United States we’ve got to do some
good work.”</p>

<p>The other boys thought so too, but they did not
lose any sleep on account of it.</p>

<span class="smaller">CASTING THE FLY.</span></h2>

<p>“Now, Curtis, bring on your moose.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a hurry. You don’t want
to crowd all your sport into the first day, do
you?”</p>

<p>“By no means. I expect to get a moose every
day.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t do it. It’s unlawful for one person
to kill more than one moose, two caribou, and
three deer in one season.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t live in such a stingy State.”</p>

<p>“You may have to some day. Wait until Mississippi
has been overrun with greedy hunters,
calling themselves sportsmen, from every part of
the Union, as Maine has, and see if your lawmakers
do not wake up to the necessity of protecting
the little game they will leave you. If those
pot-hunters were let alone, there wouldn’t be anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
for a fellow to shoot after a while. Our
laws are strict.”</p>

<p>“Are they always obeyed?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Last winter a party of Indians
camped on the headwaters of the Brokenstraw,
and killed nearly a hundred moose. When
the game-constables got after them, they ran over
to Canada. But the worst destroyers of game are
the city sportsmen. They shoot at everything
that comes within range of their guns, throw
away the trout they can’t eat, and the money they
pay for food and guides doesn’t begin to cover the
damage they do.”</p>

<p>It was a pleasant scene that was spread out
before the gaze of Don Gordon and Walter Curtis
on that bright September morning. They stood
upon the brink of a high bluff jutting out into one
of the Seven Ponds, which, at that day, were not
as widely known among the class of men whom
Walter had just been denouncing as they are at
the present time. There was a hotel at the lower
pond, but it was patronized only by adventurous
sportsmen who, as a rule, lived up to the law, and
took no more fish and game than they could dispose
of. The men who are willing to endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
almost any hardship, who brave all sorts of
weather and the miseries of “buck-board” traveling
over corduroy roads, for the sake of spending
a quiet month in the woods, are not the ones who
boast of the number of fish they catch or the
amount of game they kill. A hard fight with a
three-pound trout, or a single deer brought down
after a week’s arduous hunting, affords them more
gratification than they would find in a whole
creelful of “finger-lings,” or a cart-load of venison
killed on the runways.</p>

<p>The boys were in the midst of an almost unbroken
wilderness. On their right a noble forest,
known only to the hardy lumberman and a few
hunters and trappers, stretched away to the confines
of Canada. In front was the pond (it was
larger than Diamond Lake, whose sluggish waters
had once floated a fleet of Union gunboats), and
from the glade below them on their left arose the
smoke of the fire over which some of their companions
were cooking a late breakfast. A deep
silence brooded over the woods, broken only by an
occasional splash made by a trout as he arose to
the surface of the pond to seize some unwary
insect, and snatches of a plantation melody from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Hopkins, who sang as he superintended the frying
of the bacon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">An’ it come mighty handy to de nigger man nater</div>
<div class="verse">When he soppin’ in de gravy wid a big yam ’tater!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Southern boys had spent just three days in
Dalton, enjoying as much sport as could be
crowded into that short space of time. Everybody
showed them much attention, and the
fathers and mothers of the other members of the
club vied with Mr. and Mrs. Curtis in their offers
of hospitality. The guests were elected honorary
members of the club, and hunting and fishing
parties were the order of the day. Don caught
his first brook-trout with the little rod whose
strength he so much doubted. Bert knocked over
a brace or two of ruffed grouse, and one of the
club, having heard the visitors say that they
didn’t know what a corn-husking was, found a
farmer who had some of last year’s crop on hand,
and got up one for their especial benefit. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
was a large party of people, young and old,
assembled in the barn in which the husking
was done, and the Southerners, who were not at
all bashful or afraid of pretty girls, had any
amount of fun over the red ears of which there
seemed to be an abundant supply. On Saturday
there was glass-ball shooting on the grounds of
the club in the presence of invited guests, and
although Don Gordon did not succeed in beating
the champion, he did some shooting with the rifle
that made the club open their eyes. Using Curtis’s
Stevens he broke all the spots out of the
eight of clubs in eight consecutive shots, shooting
off-hand at the distance of fifty feet and using the
open sights. This was a feat that no one on the
grounds had ever seen accomplished before. Even
Curtis, who was the best marksman in the club,
couldn’t do it, but he declared he would before he
went back to the academy again.</p>

<p>“I tell you plainly that you’ve got a task before
you,” said Don. “The best published record is
five spots in five shots, using peep sights. This
is the best use that can be made of playing cards.
I always keep a pack of them on hand, for they
are the best kind of targets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>And that is all they are good for. If every
pack of cards in the world could be shot to pieces
as Don’s were, there would be less swindling going
on, and we should not see so much misery around
us.</p>

<p>Don and his friends made so many agreeable
acquaintances in Dalton and so thoroughly enjoyed
themselves among them, that they would
have been content to pass the whole of their
month there; but Curtis would not hear of it.
There were only ten days more in September, he
said; it would take three of them to reach their
camping grounds, and if they desired to see any
of the hunting and fishing that were to be found
in Maine, they must start at once, for their fine
fly-rods would be useless to them after the first
of October. The day which closed the time for
trout-fishing, opened the season for moose-hunting.
If Don had revealed all that was passing in
his mind, he would have said that he didn’t care
a snap for hunting or fishing either. He had seen
a pair of blue eyes and some golden ringlets whose
fair owner gazed admiringly at the shoulder-straps
he had so worthily won, and who interested him
more than all the trout that ever swam or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
lordly moose that ever roamed the forests. But
he started for the camping-ground when the
others did, submitted as patiently as he could to
the jolting he was subjected to on the corduroy
roads, and wondered what the girl he left behind
him would think if she could see him now, dressed
in a hunting suit that was decidedly the worse for
the hard service it had seen, and wearing a pair
of heavy boots, thickly coated with grease, and a
slouch hat that had once been gray, but which
had been turned to a dingy yellow by the smoke
and heat of innumerable camp fires.</p>

<p>Their party had been increased by the addition
of five of the members of the rod and gun club,
but the lodge which Curtis and some of his friends
had erected on the shore of one of the Seven
Ponds, and which was modeled after Don Gordon’s
shooting-box, was large enough to accommodate
them all. It took four wagons to transport
them and their luggage to the lodge, at
which they arrived on the evening of the third
day after leaving Dalton. They were too tired to
do much that night, but they were up at the first
peep of day, and after their luggage had been
transferred from the wagons to the lodge, the beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
made up in the bunks, the guns and fishing-rods
hung upon the hooks that had been fastened to
the walls on purpose to receive them, the canoes
put into the water (they had brought three of
these handy little crafts with them), a blaze started
in the fire-place, the chest that contained their
folding-table and camp-chairs unpacked—when
these things had been done, the little rustic house,
which was a marvel in its way, being constructed
of poles instead of boards, began to assume an air
of domesticity. The teamsters who brought them
to the pond took a hasty bite and departed, leaving
the club to themselves. There was no patient,
painstaking old cuff with them to cook
their meals and act as camp-keeper, and so the
young hunters had to do their own work. The
first morning the lot fell upon Hopkins and two
of the Dalton boys who straightway began preparations
for breakfast, while the rest strolled out
to look about them, Don and Curtis bringing up
on the edge of the bluff where we found them at
the beginning of this chapter.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">sang Hopkins, as he stood in the door of the
lodge; and when he shouted out the last line he
shook his head at Don in a way that made the
latter’s face turn as red as a beet. Hopkins evidently
knew where Don’s thoughts were.</p>

<p>“Come down from there, you two,” he exclaimed.
“The bacon is done cooked.”</p>

<p>The cool, invigorating morning air, laden as it
was with the health-giving odors of the balsam
and the pine, had bestowed upon the boys an appetite
that would not permit them to disregard
this invitation. They hastened down the bluff,
and when they entered the lodge, they found
the cooks putting breakfast on the table. They
sat down with the rest, and while they ate,
Curtis, who was the acknowledged leader of the
party, laid out a programme for the day. There
were three canoes which would accommodate two
boys each (they could be made to carry four, but
with so many in them there would not be much
elbow-room for those who wanted to fish) and two
Falstaffs to be provided for. One of them was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Hopkins and the other was Hutton, the boy who
caught the big salmon in Canada. He would
have to go, of course, for he knew all the best
places in the pond, and he was certain to bring
luck to the boy who went with him. Curtis
thought he and Bert would look well together,
while Hopkins and Farwell—the latter a light-weight
Dalton boy and a clever fly-fisher—would
make another good team. Don and Egan could
have the other canoe to themselves.</p>

<p>“But we don’t know where to go or what to
do,” said Egan. “You go in my place, and let
me stay behind as one of the camp-keepers.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> am laying out this programme,” replied
Curtis, speaking in the pompous tone that Professor
Odenheimer always assumed when he
wanted to say something impressive.</p>

<p>“I know it, but I can’t be of any use to
them,” continued Egan. “Some rioter, on the
evening of the 23d of last July, put it out of my
power to handle a paddle or a rod for some time
to come.”</p>

<p>As Egan said this he held up his bandaged
hand. His injuries were by no means so serious
as everybody thought they were going to be, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
still the wounded member was not of much use to
him. When he found that he was to be one of
Mack’s squad, he frankly told the young officer
that he could not help him; but Mack would
have taken him if he had no hands at all, for he
was fond of his company. He was afterward glad
that he did take him, for no one could have
handled the Idlewild during the pursuit with
greater skill than Egan did. If they had had
much walking to do Hopkins’ weak ankle would
have given out; but he did full duty as a foremast
hand, and proved to be of as much use as
anybody.</p>

<p>“We don’t expect you to do any work,” said
Curtis. “Let Don work, and you sit by and see
the fun. Either one of the other boats will lead
you to a good fishing-ground. Then all Don will
have to do will be to watch Hutton or Farwell
and do just as he does, and he’ll be sure to get a
rise; but whether or not he will catch a trout I
can’t say.”</p>

<p>Breakfast being over the boys paired off as Curtis
had instructed, launched the canoes and paddled
away, Bert and his fat mentor, Hutton, going
toward the lower end of the pond, and the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
turning toward the upper end. The fish were
breaking water on all sides of them, but Farwell
did not stop until he and Hopkins had run their
canoe into a little cove at the further end of the
pond, which was fed by clear cold streams that
came down from the hills.</p>

<p>“In warm weather this is the best fishing-ground
I know of,” said he, as he beckoned Don
to come alongside, “and I don’t think it is too
late in the season to have a little fun here now.
You see, trout like cold water, and they find
plenty of it here. Now, Gordon, if you will let
me see your fly-book, I will make a selection for
you while you are putting your rod together.”</p>

<p>Don handed over the book which contained
about three dozen flies that Curtis had picked out
for him in Boston. He did not know the name
of a single one of them, but Farwell did, and after
running his eye over them he said that Don had a
very good assortment.</p>

<p>“As it is broad daylight we want small flies,”
Farwell remarked. “The sun doesn’t shine very
brightly, and neither is it entirely obscured by the
clouds—the weather is rather betwixt and between;
so we will take a gaudy fly, like this scarlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
ibis, for a stretcher, and a white miller for the
other. Then the trout can take their choice.
Now, where’s your leader—a cream-colored one.
Bright and glistening ones are apt to scare the
fish, and they generally fail when the pinch comes.
It’s very provoking to have your leader break just
about the time you are ready to slip your dip-net
under a trout you have worked hard for. I hold
that two flies on one line are enough. They are
sometimes more than a novice wants to manage,
especially when he catches a weed or a root with
one hook and a trout with the other, or when two
heavy fish take his flies at the same instant and
run off in different directions. Three hooks on a
line are allowable only when you are out of grub,
and the trout don’t run over fifty to the pound.
But then we don’t catch such fish in these
ponds.”</p>

<p>The Southerners listened with all their ears and
closely watched Farwell, who, while he was talking,
deftly fastened the flies he had selected upon
the leader, bent the leader on to the line, and was
about to pass the fully equipped rod back to its
owner, when a large trout shot out of the water
about fifty feet away, giving them a momentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
glimpse of his gleaming sides before he fell back
into his native element. Don withdrew the hand
he had extended for the rod and looked at Farwell.</p>

<p>“Shall I take him for you and show you how
it is done?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered all the boys, at once.</p>

<p>“Well, in order to do it, I shall have to throw
the flies right over that swirl. What are you
going to do with that paddle, Hopkins?”</p>

<p>“I was going to pull the canoe up nearer,”
replied the latter.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to go any nearer.”</p>

<p>“Why, you can’t reach him from here,” said
Egan.</p>

<p>“And if you hook him he will break the rod
into a thousand pieces,” chimed in Don. “I
know I made a mistake when I bought that flimsy
little thing.”</p>

<p>Farwell smiled but said nothing. Grasping the
rod in his right hand above the reel he drew off as
much line as he thought he needed, and then
threw the flexible tip smartly upward and backward,
causing the flies to describe a circle around
his head. One would have thought from his actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
that he was going to strike the water with
the rod, but he didn’t. When the rod reached a
horizontal position it stopped there, but the flies
had received an impetus that carried them onward
almost to the edge of the weeds, and landed them
on the water as lightly as a feather and right in
the center of the swirl. It was neatly and gracefully
done; but before Don and his companions
could express their delight and admiration, the
scarlet ibis suddenly disappeared, the line was
drawn as tight as a bow-string and the pliant rod
was bent almost half double. Farwell had hooked
his fish, and now the fun began.</p>

<p>The trout fought hard but he did not break the
rod as Don had predicted, and neither did the boy
with whom he was battling show half as much
excitement as did the others who sat by and
watched the contest. They had never dreamed
that there was so much sport in fishing, and there
wasn’t in the way they generally fished, with a
heavy pole and a line strong enough to jerk their
prize from the water the moment he was hooked.
Don, as we have said, had caught a few trout in
the brooks about Dalton, but he had not done it
in any such scientific way as this. Being distrustful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of his rod he had seized the line and lifted the
fish out by main strength—a most unsportsmanlike
thing to do. He closely observed all Farwell’s
movements, and when at last the exhausted
trout was dipped out of the water with the landing-net
and deposited in the bottom of the canoe,
he thought he had made himself master of the art
of fly-fishing. But when he came to try casting
he found he was mistaken. His flies went almost
everywhere except in the direction he desired to
throw them, and annoyed him by catching in his
coat-tail when he tried to throw them over his
head; but after patient and careful practice in
making short casts he finally “got the hang of the
thing,” as he expressed it, and after that he did
better. The string of fish he took back to the
lodge with him at noon was not a very large one,
but the few he caught afforded him an abundance
of sport, and that was just what he wanted.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>Having gained a little insight into the art of
casting the fly, Don and his friends became
eager and enthusiastic fishermen. They were on
the pond almost all the time, and as they tried
hard to follow the instructions that were willingly
and patiently given them, and would not allow
themselves to become discouraged by their numerous
blunders and failures, they finally became
quite expert with their light tackle. They wound
up the season with a glorious catch, and then
oiled their rods and put them into their cases
with many sighs of regret.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Curtis, soothingly.
“There’s no loss without some gain, and now we
will turn our attention to bigger things than
speckled trout. To-night we will try this.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he took from a chest something
that looked like a dark-lantern with a leather helmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
fastened to the bottom of it. And that was
just what it was. When Curtis put the helmet
on his head, the lantern stood straight up on top
of it.</p>

<p>“This is a jack,” said he, “and it is used
in fire-hunting. As soon as it grows dark some
of us will get into a canoe and paddle quietly
around the pond just outside of the lilies and
grass. The fellow who is to do the shooting will
wear this jack on his head. It will be lighted,
but the slide will be turned in front of it, making
it dark. When he hears a splashing in the water
close in front of him he will turn on the light by
throwing back the slide, and if he makes no noise
about it and is quick with his gun, he will get a
deer, and we shall have venison to take the place
of the trout.”</p>

<p>This was something entirely new to the
Southerners, who carefully examined the jack and
listened with much interest while Curtis and his
friends told stories of their experience and exploits
in fire-hunting. Deer were so abundant about
Rochdale that those who hunted them were not
obliged to resort to devices of this kind, and in
Maryland, where Hopkins lived, they were followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
with hounds and shot on the runways.
Egan had never hunted deer. He devoted all his
spare time to canvas-backs and red-heads. They
spent the forenoon in talking of their adventures,
and after dinner Bert and Hutton, who had become
inseparable companions, strolled off with their
double-barrels in search of grouse, and Curtis and
Don pushed off in one of the canoes to make a
voyage of discovery to the upper pond; the former,
for the first time, taking his rifle with him. He
was afterward glad that he had done so, for he
made a shot before he came back that gave him
something to talk about and feel good over all the
rest of the year.</p>

<p>Don and his companion paddled leisurely along
until they reached the upper end of the pond, and
then the canoe was turned into the weeds, through
which it was forced into a wide and deep brook
communicating with another pond that lay a few
miles deeper in the forest. Curtis said there was
fine trapping along the banks of the brook, adding
that if Don and Bert would stay and take a
Thanksgiving dinner with him, as he wanted
them to do, they would put out a “saple line.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing but a lot of traps,” replied Curtis.
“When a man starts out to see what he has
caught, he says he is going to make the rounds of
his saple line. There are lots of mink, marten
and muskrats about here, and now and then one
can catch a beaver or an otter; but he’s not
always sure of getting him if he does catch him,
for it’s an even chance if some prowling luciver
doesn’t happen along and eat him up.”</p>

<p>“What’s a luciver?” inquired Don.</p>

<p>“It’s the meanest animal we have about here,
and is as cordially hated by our local trappers as
the wolverine is by the trappers in the west. It’s
a lynx. A full-grown one would scare you if you
should happen to come suddenly upon him in the
woods; and after you had killed him and taken
his hide off you would feel ashamed of yourself,
for you would find him to be about half as large
as you thought he was. They don’t average over
thirty or forty pounds—one weighing fifty would
be a whopper—but they’re ugly, and would just
as soon pitch into a fellow as not. I have heard
some remarkable stories——”</p>

<p>Curtis did not finish the sentence. He stopped
suddenly, looked hard at the bushes ahead of him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
listening intently all the while, and finally he
drew his paddle out of the water and gently poked
Don in the back with the blade. When Don
faced about to see what he wanted, Curtis laid his
finger upon his lips, at the same time slowly and
silently turning the bow of the canoe toward the
nearest bank. Just then Don heard twigs snapping
in front of him, the sound being followed by
a slight splashing in the water as if some heavy
animal were walking cautiously through it. His
lips framed the question: “What is it?” and
Curtis’s silent but unmistakable reply was:
“Moose!”</p>

<p>For the first and only time in his life Don Gordon
had an attack of the “buck-ague.” His
nerves, usually so firm and steady, thrilled with
excitement, and his hand trembled as he laid
down his paddle and picked up his rifle. He had
not yet obtained the smallest glimpse of the animal,
but his ears told him pretty nearly where he
was.</p>

<p>As soon as he had placed his rifle in position
for a shot, Curtis gave one swift, noiseless stroke
with his paddle, sending the canoe away from the
bank again, and up the stream, Don trying hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
to peer through the bushes, and turning his body
at all sorts of angles in the hope of obtaining a
view of the quarry; but the alders were thick,
and he could not see a dozen yards in advance of
him, until Curtis brought him to a place where
the bank was comparatively clear, and then Don
discovered something through a little opening in
the thicket. He raised his hand, and the canoe
stopped.</p>

<p>“That thing can’t be a moose,” thought Don,
rubbing his eyes and looking again. “It’s too
big, and besides it’s black.”</p>

<p>In twisting about on his seat to obtain a clearer
view of the huge creature, whatever it was, Don
accidentally touched the paddle, the handle of
which slipped off the thwart and fell to the bottom
of the canoe. The effect was magical. In
an instant the dark, sleek body at which Don had
been gazing through the opening in the bushes
gave place to an immense head, crowned with
enormous ears and wide-spreading palmated antlers,
and a pair of gleaming eyes which seemed to
be glaring straight at him. It was a savage looking
head, taken altogether, but Don never took
his gaze from it as his rifle rose slowly to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
shoulder. He looked through the sights for an
instant, covering one of the eyes with the front
bead, and pressed the trigger. The rifle cracked
and so did the bushes, as the animal launched
itself through them toward the bank with one
convulsive spring. Their tops were violently agitated
for a moment, then all was still, and Don
turned about and looked at Curtis.</p>

<p>“You’ve got him,” said the latter, dipping his
paddle into the water and sending the canoe ahead
again.</p>

<p>“I’ve got something,” replied Don, “but it
can’t be a moose.”</p>

<p>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p>“I think it is an elephant.”</p>

<p>Curtis laughed until the woods echoed.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said Don, doggedly. “He’s
got an elephant’s ears.”</p>

<p>“Do an elephant’s ears stick straight out from
his head, and does he carry horns?” demanded
Curtis, as soon as he could speak. “Elephants
don’t run wild in this country—at least I never
heard of any being seen about here. It’s a moose,
easy enough. I saw his horns through the alders,
and I tell you they are beauties. If you were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
taxidermist now, you could provide an ornament
for your father’s hall or dining-room that would
be worth looking at.”</p>

<p>It was a moose, sure enough, as the boys found
when they paddled around the bushes and landed
on the bank above them. There he lay, shot
through the brain, and looking larger than he did
when he was alive. His shape was clumsy and
uncouth, but his agility must have been something
wonderful; his expiring effort certainly
was. He lay fully six feet from the bank, which
was about five feet in height. The place where
he had been feeding, which was pointed out to the
boys by the muddy water and by the trampled
lilies and pickerel grass, was thirty feet from
the foot of the bank; so the moose, with a ball
in his brain, must have cleared at least thirty-six
feet at one jump. His long, slender legs did
not look as though they were strong enough to
support so ponderous a body, to say nothing of
sending it through the air in that fashion.</p>

<p>“Do you know that I was afraid of him?” said
Don, after he had feasted his eyes upon his prize
and entered in his note-book some measurements
he had made. “When he was staring at me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
through those bushes, I thought I had never seen
so savage a looking beast in all my life.”</p>

<p>“He was savage, and you had good reason to
be afraid of him,” answered Curtis, quickly. “If
you had wounded him he would have trampled us
out of sight in the brook before we knew what
hurt us. When his horns are in the velvet the
moose is a timid and retiring animal; but after
his antlers are fully grown, and he has sharpened
and polished them by constant rubbing against
the trees, he loses his fear of man and everything
else, and would rather fight than eat. Now you
would like to have Bert and the rest see him, I
suppose. Well, if you will stay here and watch
him, I will go down and bring them up. We’ll
camp here to-night, for we shall have to cut the
moose up before we can take him away. He’s
heavy, and weighs close to seven or eight hundred
pounds.”</p>

<p>Don agreeing to this proposition, Curtis stepped
into the canoe and paddled toward the pond, not
forgetting to leave the axe they had brought with
them so that his companion could start a fire and
build a shanty during his absence. But Don was
in no hurry to go to work. He was so highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
elated at his success that he could not bring his
mind down to anything. For a long time he sat
on the ground beside the moose, wondering at his
gigantic proportions and verifying the measurements
he had taken, and it was not until he heard
voices in the brook below him that he jumped to
his feet and caught up the axe. He had a cheerful
fire going when his friends arrived, but there
were no signs of a shanty.</p>

<p>“Look here,” shouted Bert, as he drew his
canoe broadside to the bank. “You were good,
enough to keep your moose until we could have a
look at him, and so I brought my trophies along.
You needn’t think you are the only one who has
gained honors to-day. What do you think of
<i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>As Bert said this, he and Hutton lifted a queer
looking animal from the bottom of the canoe and
threw it upon the bank. It was about as large as
an ordinary dog, rather short and strongly built,
with sharp, tufted ears and feet that were thickly
padded with fur. Its claws were long and sharp,
and so were the teeth that could be seen under its
upraised lip. Its back was slightly arched, and
as it lay there on the bank it looked a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
like an overgrown cat that was about to go into
battle. Don had never seen anything like it
before.</p>

<p>“What in the world is it?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That’s just the question I asked myself when
I stumbled on him and his mate a little while
ago,” said Bert. “It’s a luciver.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the other,” cried Curtis; and a second
lynx, somewhat smaller than the first, was tossed
ashore. “It’s the greatest wonder to me that
they didn’t make mince-meat of Bert, and I believe
they would have done it if he hadn’t been so
handy with that pop-gun of his.”</p>

<p>“Well, that pop-gun had proved itself to be a
pretty good shooter,” returned Bert, complacently.
“You see, Don, I was beating a coppice in which
Hutton told me I would be likely to flush a
grouse or two, and Hutton himself was on the
other side of the ridge. All on a sudden I felt a
thrill run all through me, and there right in front
of me, and not more than ten feet away, was this
big lynx. Of course he heard me coming, but as
he was making a meal off a grouse he had just
killed, he didn’t want to leave it. He humped up
his back, spread out his claws, showed his teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and <i>spit</i> just like a cat; and believing that he
was going to jump at me, I knocked him over,
giving him a charge of number eight shot full in
the face. It killed him so dead that he never
stirred out of his tracks, but he looked so ugly
that I was afraid to approach him. While I was
thinking about it, I happened to cast my eyes a
little to the right, and there was his mate looking
at me over a log. I gave him the other barrel,
and he came for me.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Don, looking first
at his brother’s slender figure and then at the
dead luciver’s strong teeth and claws. Bert was
too frail to make much of a fight against such
weapons as those.</p>

<p>“But the luciver didn’t get him,” chimed in
Hutton, “although he made things lively for him
for a little while. I heard the rumpus, and knowing
that Bert had got into trouble, I ran over the
ridge to take a hand in it. When I got into the
thicket there was Bert, making good time around
trees, over logs and behind stumps, and the luciver
was close at his heels, following him by scent and
hearing, as I afterward learned, and not by sight,
for Bert’s shot had blinded him. While I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
watching for a chance to fire at him, Bert, who
was trying his best to load his gun as he ran,
managed to shove in a cartridge, and after that
the matter was quickly settled.”</p>

<p>“Don got the moose, but I had the excitement,”
added Bert.</p>

<p>The young hunters ate a hearty supper that
night, but they slept well after it, for they did not
go to bed till they had cut up the moose, and
hung the quarters out of reach of any prowling
lucivu that might happen to come that way. The
habits of this animal and those of the moose
afforded them topics for conversation long after
they sought their blankets, and the sun arose before
they did.</p>

<p>Stowing the heavy carcass in their cranky little
canoes and transporting it to the lodge occupied
the better portion of the day, but they were
not too tired to await the return of the fire-hunters,
who set out at dark in quest of deer. They
returned at midnight and reported that they had
“shone the eyes” of two which they could have
shot if they had been so disposed; but being
sportsmen instead of butchers they could not see
any sense in shooting game they could not use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
About the time they began to look for the teamsters,
who had been engaged to return on a certain
day and carry them and their luggage back to
Dalton, they would begin fire-hunting in earnest,
and procure a supply of venison for the club-dinner,
which was to be eaten before the Southern
boys went home.</p>

<p>The days passed rapidly, and every one brought
with it some agreeable occupation. Curtis and the
other Dalton boys took care to see that the time
did not hang heavily upon the hands of the
guests, and were always thinking up something
new for them. The teamsters came as they
promised, and found four fine deer waiting for
them. The next morning the wagons were loaded,
the foremost one being crowned by the antlers of
Don’s moose, to show the people along the road
that one of their number had gained renown while
they had been in the woods, and the homeward
journey was begun.</p>

<p>If time would permit we might tell of some
interesting incidents that happened in connection
with the club dinner, which came off on the evening
of the last day that Don and his companions
spent in Dalton. To quote from some of the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
who sat down to it, “the spread was fine,” so were
the toasts, speeches and songs, and Don Gordon
had abundant opportunity to talk to the owner of
the eyes and the curls that had haunted him every
day of the long month he spent at the lodge.
He would have been glad to stay in Dalton
always. He said he was coming back, but the
excuse he gave was that he wanted another trial
at glass-balls with the champion. Perhaps his
friends believed that that was his only reason for
desiring to return, and perhaps they didn’t. At
any rate they looked very wise, and exchanged
many a significant wink with one another.</p>

<p>“Good by, boys,” said Egan, when the stage-coach
drew up in front of Mr. Curtis’s door the
next morning. “We are indebted to you for a
splendid time, and we should like a chance to
reciprocate. Curtis is going to spend a month
with me next fall, and I should be delighted to
have you come with him. Don, Bert and Hop
will be there too, and we’ll make it as pleasant as
we can for you.”</p>

<p>The Southern boys separated in Boston and
took their way toward their respective homes, Don
and Bert stopping in Cincinnati long enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
purchase a couple of revolving-traps and a supply
of glass-balls, and reaching Rochdale in due time
without any mishap. Their shoulder-straps created
all the surprise that Don could have desired,
and the latter knew by the way his mother kissed
him that she was entirely satisfied with the way
he had conducted himself during his last year
at school. They never grew weary of talking
about the fine times they had enjoyed at the lodge,
and Don gave everybody to understand that he was
going back to Dalton some day on purpose to win
that medal from the champion. He had a right
to compete for it now, for he was a member of the
club.</p>

<p>“But you will have to win it three times before
you can bring it home with you,” said Bert.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” answered Don, “for
then I can see that handsome little—ah! I mean
the lodge, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Bert, dryly.</p>

<p>“By the way, has anybody heard anything of
Lester Brigham and Jones and Williams?” exclaimed
Don, anxious to change the subject.</p>

<p>Yes, everybody had heard of them. Mr. Brigham
had been industriously circulating the articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and papers that Lester had sent him, and had
celebrated his son’s return by giving a big supper
and a party. The house was crowded, and Lester
and Enoch were lionized to their hearts’ content.</p>

<p>Don and Bert spent a portion of their next
vacation at the homes of Egan and Hopkins as
they had promised, seeing no end of sport and
some little excitement. What they did for amusement,
and what Lester and his enemies did when
they returned to Bridgeport in January, shall be
narrated in the third and concluding volume of
this series, which will be entitled: “<span class="smcap">The Young
Wild-Fowlers.</span>”</p>
